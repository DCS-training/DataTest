                        World-first allows people to better understand courtroom process.
                    

Victims and witnesses are set to use virtual reality headsets to familiarise themselves with giving evidence in court as part of a pioneering Scottish-Government initiative to allay fears or discomfort around the process.
Ahead of giving evidence in court, the world-leading £500,000 virtual court project will allow victims to ‘walk through’ a 3-dimensional world, comprising actual videos of the court building where their case will be held. The system uses cutting-edge software to allow victims and witnesses to interact in a virtual environment that includes depictions of the people and objects they can expect to encounter when they go to court.
The project will enable victims and witnesses to be supported at all times by Victim Support Scot* (VSS) volunteers as they experience the virtual court environment. This will remove the need to travel to court prior to their hearing date, while allowing people to familiarise themselves with what can be an unfamiliar, daunting and often retraumatising environment.
The project - a partnership between VSS, tech provider Immersonal and CivTech, the world’s first successful public-sector-focused innovation accelerator - has delivered a working prototype for Glasgow Sheriff Court and the High Court in Glasgow with wider development and roll out over the next year. 
Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Home Affairs Angela Constance said:
“We continue to put victims at the heart of the criminal justice system, their needs are an absolute priority. However victims and witnesses can naturally find giving evidence a daunting prospect. This unique project, using innovative technology to support and prepare victims for attending court, could prove transformative.
“It has the potential to reduce anxiety and additional trauma, and also reduces the need to travel often long distances for victims to familiarise themselves with a new environment before experiencing it ‘in real life’. We hope that this will reduce retraumatisation and anxiety, supporting victims to give the highest quality evidence.
“This project is part of the Scottish-Government‘s wider work that has seen more than £93 million invested through the justice budget over the past five years to prioritise victims' rights and needs. Our Victim Centred Approach Fund continues this important commitment, making £48 million available to victims’ organisations.”
Chief Executive of Victim Support Scot* Kate Wallace said:
“Victims and witnesses often tell us of the retraumatising effects caused by giving evidence in court and that it can cause as much anxiety as the crime itself. Victim Support Scot* strongly advocates for victims being able to give evidence remotely and in trauma-informed environments. 
“This virtual reality experience will provide just that and can be accessed through a headset available with the help of volunteers from Victim Support Scot*, as well as through laptops, smart phones and tablets thereby offering more choice and access about how to prepare for court at a time and place that suits the victim.”
Background 
The cost of the project is being met by CivTech (£393,000) and the Scottish-Government (£131,000). VSS is now working with Immersonal on the first steps towards making the experience available at all 52 criminal courts in Scot*.
CivTech is a partnership between the Scottish-Government’s Digital and Economic Directorates. Its mission is to drive daring and innovation in the public and third sectors by collaboratively solving challenges to make people’s lives better – and in doing so create generations of sustainable, high growth potential businesses. Its Vision is a transformed Scot*, with the best public services in the world. 
Victim Support Scot* is a victim support organisation that provides free advice and support to victims.
Immersonal is a Northern Ireland-based product development company that creates bespoke virtual reality applications. They were successfully selected to join the CivTech programme after submitting their proposed solution.
The Scottish-Government’s Victim Centred Approach Fund is providing £48 million over three-years to fund support for victims’ organisations across Scot*.
Victims will continue to have the option of in-person court familiarisation visits, in tandem with the virtual visits.            ",14/04/2023,Virtual reality helping victims

                        Request for judicial review of UK Government use of veto.
                    

The Scottish-Government will challenge the Secretary of State for Scot*’s use of Section 35 of the Scot* Act to stop the Gender Recognition Reform (Scot*) Bill going forward to Royal Assent following the Scot*Parliament’s approval of the legislation in December 2022.

Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville has informed the Scot*Parliament that the Scottish-Government will lodge a petition for a judicial review of the Secretary of State for Scot*’s use of Section 35.

Ms Somerville said:

“The Gender Recognition Reform Bill was passed by an overwhelming majority of the Scot*Parliament, with support from members of all parties.

“The use of Section 35 is an unprecedented challenge to the Scot*Parliament’s ability to legislate on clearly devolved matters and it risks setting a dangerous constitutional precedent.

“In seeking to uphold the democratic will of the Parliament and defend devolution, Scot*Ministers will lodge a petition for a judicial review of the Secretary of State for Scot*’s decision.

“The UK Government gave no advance warning of their use of the power, and neither did they ask for any amendments to the Bill throughout its nine month passage through Parliament. Our offers to work with the UK Government on potential changes to the Bill have been refused outright by the Secretary of State, so legal challenge is our only reasonable means of resolving this situation.

“It is important to have clarity on the interpretation and scope of the Section 35 power and its impact on devolution. These matters should be legally tested in the courts.”

Background

Written Question Reference: S6W-17198

The Gender Recognition Reform (Scot*) Bill was passed by the Scot*Parliament on 22 December 2022 by 86 to 39 with members of all parties supporting the bill.

In January 2023, the UK Government used Section 35 of the Scot* Act 1998 to stop the Bill being put forward for Royal Assent.

The Gender Recognition Reform Bill improved the system by which transgender people with a Scot*birth register entry or who are ordinarily resident in Scot* can apply for legal recognition through a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC). Trans people have been able to apply for legal gender recognition through a GRC since 2004. Not all trans people have a GRC and no-one is required to have one.

The Bill includes safeguards against misuse of the system. It will be a criminal offence for applicants to make a false application. A new statutory aggravator and a risk-based approach in relation to sex offences strengthen these protections.              ",12/04/2023,Section 35 Order challenge

                        Legislation strengthened to prevent the spread of infection.
                    

Farmers bringing cattle into Scot* will be subject to tighter controls in order to reduce the risk of spreading Bovine Tuberculosis (TB).

From 18 May, changes to legislation will come into force which will require stricter pre-movement testing of cattle, adding extra precautions for animals coming from areas of higher risk of infection.

In addition, compensation will be reduced for any unclean cattle slaughtered for TB control purposes. This will incentivise farmers to keep their animals clean and promote better animal health and welfare.

A new definition for isolation will also be introduced, and compensation will be reduced for cattle which are not properly isolated. This will strengthen the protection of the main herd against onward spread of infection from any reactors or suspect reactors.

Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said:

“Although Scot* is officially TB free, cases do still occur - and breakdowns are extremely disruptive, upsetting and distressing for cattle owners.

“We are committed to maintaining Scot*’s low TB infection rates and OTF status, which is crucial to the success of our cattle industry.

“These legislative changes are part of a comprehensive, practical and proportionate programme of measures to minimise the risks from all potential sources of infection and reduce the risk of disease spread as far as possible.

“Guidance on TB is available on the Scottish-Government’s website and we will ensure farmers are kept up to date with the situation in Scot*. We will continue to support farmers affected by TB in partnership with the Animal and Plant Health Agency.”

NFU Scot* Vice President Alasdair Macnab said:

“Scot*cattle keepers are proud of Scot*’s Officially TB Free status (OTF) and remain committed to keeping TB out of Scot*.

“NFUS welcomes Scottish-Government’s commitment to continually reviewing the processes in place to protect Scot*’s cattle herd and to make sure they remain fit for purpose.

“The changes to the pre-movement test requirements and improved clarity around isolation are being introduced following a consultation process and should offer increased confidence to keepers.

“NFUS urges Scot*cattle keepers to remain aware that the greatest risk of introducing TB into Scot* is from cattle movements, and to continue to ensure their sourcing policies will minimise the risk to their own holding and the national herd.”

Background

Scot* was recognised as being officially TB free (OTF) by the European Commission in September 2009. Maintaining OTF status is crucial to the continuing success of the Scot*cattle industry which is regulated in terms of controls for TB by the Tuberculosis (Scot*) Order.

The new pre-movement testing requirements apply to cattle coming to Scot* from a TB high incidence area, including those coming from a low incidence TB area that have been in a high incidence TB high incidence area in any time of their life.

Eligible cattle, as above, will require a clear pre-movement test within 30 days prior to the movement to Scot* if tested after 18 May. This requirement was previously 60 days. Additional changes also mean that a negative TB test in a herd under movement restrictions will no longer be accepted as a qualifying pre-movement test, even if the test allows these restrictions to be lifted.

A public consultation took place on Citizens Space between 9 May – 1 August 2022, a total period of 12 weeks. The responses provided feedback which has been used to inform how legislation on TB in Scot* should be developed. It was clear that there is support among the various respondent groups for the changes being made under this amendment. A full consultation analysis is available at https://www.gov.scot/publications/bovine-tuberculosis-summary-consultation-responses/

                        Ensuring everyone has a home that meets their needs.
                    

Increasing and accelerating housing supply, tackling homelessness, ending rough sleeping and progressing Scot*’s 20-year housing plan are key priorities for Housing Minister Paul McLennan.

On his first public visit as Housing Minister, Mr McLennan visited the Letham Mains housing development in Haddington and saw first-hand how Scottish-Government funding is supporting local councils and housing associations to deliver energy-efficient homes that meet the needs of communities across Scot*.

Outlining his priorities, Mr McLennan said:

“My aim is for everyone to have a warm, safe, affordable home that meets their needs and these 37 new social rented homes in Haddington by East Lothian Council, supported by £2.2 million of Scottish-Government funding, will make a real and lasting difference to the lives of the new residents.

“Housing to 2040 sets out the vision for what we want Scot*’s homes and communities to look like. That includes ensuring people have access to green space and essential services, and putting an end to fuel poverty and homelessness.  

“Scot* has led the way in delivering affordable housing across the UK, with more than 118,000 homes delivered since 2007 and we are committed to delivering on our target of 110,000 affordable homes by 2032, of which at least 70% will be available for social rent and 10% will be in our remote, rural and island communities.

“I am well aware of the global issues affecting construction which are impacting housing delivery. I am confident, however, that with the continued support of our partners we can achieve our shared goal of delivering more affordable homes for the people of Scot*.

“Scot* has the strongest rights for homeless households in the UK and we are looking to strengthen these further - taking steps to reduce stays in temporary accommodation, eradicate rough sleeping and prevent homelessness from happening in the first place.

“We are also taking steps to make the right to an adequate home a reality, tackle high rents and increase stability for those in the private rented sector and give local authorities the tools they need to improve access to housing in their local areas.

“I look forward to working with all partners in the coming months as we redouble our efforts to support a robust and strong housing system for now and the future.”

East Lothian Council’s Cabinet Spokesperson for Housing and Property Maintenance, Councillor Andy Forrest, said:

“I was pleased to welcome the Housing Minister to this latest phase of the wider development at Letham Mains, which is providing 800 much-needed new homes for this area including affordable housing and, of course, the new Letham Mains Primary School. Letham also includes a local centre, community facilities and transport links. This site forms part of the council’s general commitment to build almost 2,000 new affordable homes between now and the financial year 2026/27.

""East Lothian Council is fully committed to preventing and tackling homelessness and welcomes continued engagement with the Scottish-Government, and now with our new Minister, to jointly address housing issues and pressures specific to East Lothian.”

Tommy Stirling, Production Director for Taylor Wimpey East Scot* adds:

“We are pleased to have had the opportunity to meet the new Housing Minister, Paul McLennan, during his visit to Letham Mains. We are proud of our long and established relationship with East Lothian Council, which has and continues to deliver much-needed affordable homes locally at Letham Mains, Haddington.  This visit was a great opportunity for the Minister to see first-hand the high-quality affordable homes that we are building.”

Background

Housing to 2040 is Scot*’s long-term strategy for housing. It was developed following extensive engagement with the housing sector, wider stakeholders and the public, and sets out a vision for what we want Scot*’s homes and communities to look like by the end of 2040.

Scot*’s first array of floating solar panels will be installed this year as part of an innovative move to generate renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions.

First Minister Humza Yousaf toured the manufacturing facility of Nova Innovation in Leith where the panels are being tested before their launch.

The company installed the world’s first offshore tidal turbine array in Shetland in 2016 and subsequently received £6.4 million from the Scot*National Investment Bank in September 2021 to boost production of innovative renewable energy generators.

It has since established project sites in Canada, France and Indonesia. Its floating solar panels build on its expertise in tidal energy and an official launch of the installation will take place later this year with a multi-megawatt international order already in the pipeline.

The First Minister said:

“These panels give a fascinating glimpse into the opportunities for Scot*’s future energy system and are the first step towards harnessing our significant potential for floating solar.

“The investment by the Scot*National Investment Bank in Nova Innovation helped expand its manufacturing base here in Leith and aligned strongly with the Scottish-Government’s priority of supporting innovative technology that will help us achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2045.

“Scot* is already one of the most advanced hubs in Europe for the testing and demonstration of marine energy technology and I look forward to seeing where the panels will be launched in the near future.”

Chief Executive of Nova Innovation Simon Forrest said:

“With record-high energy prices and growing concerns over security of supply, there is an immediate need for Scot* to focus on homegrown energy from our abundant natural resources. 

“Scot* is at the heart of the tidal energy revolution and Nova continues to lead the sector with proven technology and unrivalled reliability. With the addition of floating solar to our portfolio, we are ideally placed to help drive the race to Net Zero.

                        New Framework to enhance engagement.
                    

A new framework to strengthen Scot*’s engagement with global connections has been published.

The Scot*Connections Framework seeks to expand links and networks with:

Scot*people living elsewhere in the world
 those with Scot*heritage
 people who have previously lived in Scot*, including alumni
 those with a professional, business, cultural or other links to Scot*
The Framework outlines commitments to Scot*’s global communities, recognising the benefits of international collaboration for both Scot* and the diaspora across the world.

As part of the Framework, a number of projects will be expanded or launched including a Scot*Connections Challenge Fund to support initiatives that promote Scot*’s reputation and interests.

During the lifetime of this Parliament, a recognition award to highlight the achievements of Scot*diaspora internationally will also be launched and an external advisory group will be established to shape proposed and future work with the diaspora.

External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson said:

“Scot* is an open, connected and outward-looking country with a long and proud history of intellectual, cultural and economic exchange.

“Recent research suggested that upwards of 40 million people across the world consider themselves to have Scot*heritage but the approach set out in Scot*Connections goes far beyond bloodlines. Recognising and engaging our diaspora is an objective in itself – not a means to an end. Scot*’s diaspora and our Scot*Connections are an extension of Scot* – our living bridge with people, organisations and communities around the world.

“Publishing this Framework will unlock many opportunities for Scots and those connected to Scot* across the world. Connecting with our international diaspora will enable us to learn from their skills, experiences and achievements. I look forward to discussing the Framework in detail with our friends and partners in New York City as part of the 25th anniversary of Tartan Week – itself a leading global event to celebrate Scot*’s contributions to the world.”

                        New campaign promoting disability benefits launched
                    

Disabled people are being urged to find out if they are eligible for Scottish-Government disability benefits as part of a new campaign to increase benefit take-up. 

The nationwide campaign aims to raise awareness about financial support available to help with the extra costs that disabled children and adults may face.

Child Disability Payment provides financial support to help families and carers with the extra costs of caring for a disabled child or young person or a child or young person with a long-term health condition. Adult Disability Payment is available to   people aged between 16 and state pension age who are disabled, have a long-term health condition or a terminal illness.

These benefits are administered by Social Security Scot* and replace the Department for Work and Pensions’ Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for Children, DLA and Personal Independence Payment.

People already getting disability benefits from DWP will see their award transfer automatically and they do not need to apply separately. 

Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:

“Being disabled or having a long-term health condition can come with a variety of extra costs, such as paying more for accessible transport. We want to make sure that disabled children and adults get all the extra financial support they are entitled to, to ease the impact of those costs.

“This campaign is not just about raising awareness but also has an important role to play in helping to remove any stigma that people may be worried about when applying for social security. We believe social security is a human right. It is here for any of us should we need it and we want to make sure people are accessing what they are due.

“This is the first time that we are proactively promoting disability benefits as part of a national advertising campaign, including adverts on TV. We are not aware of the UK Government running a campaign on the equivalent UK benefits for over 30-years. I want to actively encourage people to check if they are eligible for Child and Adult Disability Payments and make sure they get extra financial support to help them live full and independent lives.”

The campaign features Piper, 9, who has Down's Syndrome. Her mum Caroline Milburn, says disability benefits have helped cover extra costs as well as give Piper opportunities she’d never have had without them.

Caroline, from Edinburgh, said: “Piper is such a unique character. When she was born we were told she wouldn’t walk until she was around six, but she was walking at two. She’s so determined and knows her own mind. If she wants to do something she’ll do it.

“Disability benefit allowed me to buy her a sensory swing and a tablet that gives her access to games that help her learn. She just thinks she’s having fun but the games have taught her so much. She plays them with her five-year-old brother sitting beside her and he learns with her.

“Child Disability Payment helps cover the costs of buying Piper new clothes and duvets as she is always chewing holes in them  It also allows me to send her to holiday clubs. She loves them and they’re really good for her, but they cost about £40 a week.

“Piper is such an amazing girl and she makes everyone’s lives better. Without disability benefits we’d not have been able to give her all the experiences and opportunities she’s had to learn and connect with the world.”

Innovative companies will be able to trial new health products in clinical settings across the country following a link-up between the Scottish-Government’s £42 million Techscaler programme and the NHS.

Participants in the programme, which provides world class expertise and support to young businesses with high growth potential, are being offered access to NHS Regional Test Beds. These enable entrepreneurs to work alongside clinicians and have access to patients and anonymised data to test ideas, products and services.

And in a reciprocal agreement, firms already using the NHS Test Beds will automatically become part of the Techscaler network.

Wellbeing Economy Secretary Neil Gray announced the move during a visit to Bioliberty in Edinburgh, which uses robotics to provide rehabilitation and assistance for stroke survivors. The company will be one of 14 firms in sectors including healthtech and life sciences to join a Scottish-Government-funded visit to New York to showcase their work.

Mr Gray said:

“Scot*’s life sciences sector has an annual turnover of more than £8 billion and is one of our key sectors for transformative economic growth. This partnership will be able to leverage our world-leading universities, life sciences hubs and excellent healthcare systems to support the growth of the sector and development of entrepreneurs.

“Testing products in a real world environment and accelerating development is vital, and will enable a broader reach of the Tech Scaler programme. This in turn will benefit patients and medical staff as they develop cutting-edge technology for use across the NHS, from stroke and rehabilitation through to reducing drug-related deaths.

“It is a further example of the steps we are taking as we develop a sustainable, high-skill economy that works for everyone.”

Chief Scientist (Health) Anna Dominiczak said:

“I welcome this collaboration, which will result in transformative innovations for the NHS and help to ensure that Scot* is the best location for life sciences companies.”

Scot*’s Chief Entrepreneur Mark Logan said:

“By making this connection between health testing and business support, we create an environment for innovation which enables Scot*companies to compete effectively, whilst bringing much-needed treatment solutions to the NHS.”

                        Additional half a billion pounds raised for public services.
                    

Changes to income tax in Scot* have come into force and are estimated to raise more than half a billion pounds of additional revenue this financial year to support vital public services.

The tax rates for earnings between £12,571 and £43,662 remain the same while earnings above £43,663 are now taxed at the Higher tax rate of 42%.

The threshold at which people pay the Top Rate of tax has reduced from £150,000 to £125,140 with earnings over that threshold now taxed at 47%.

According to the Scot*Fiscal Commission, these changes will raise £129 million in 2023-24.

The Higher Rate threshold will also remain at its 2022-23 level, applying to earnings over £43,662, which will increase revenue by a further £390 million when compared to uprating the threshold by inflation, according to Scottish-Government estimates.

As the new financial year begins, Scot*taxpayers are also being encouraged to check if their tax code on their first payslip is correct – people paying Scot*Income Tax should have a tax code that starts with an S.

Deputy First Minister Shona Robison said:

“The decisions we have made on income tax are fair and progressive by ensuring that those who can, contribute more. They strengthen our social contract with the people of Scot* who will continue to enjoy many benefits not available in the rest of the UK such as free prescriptions.

“The additional revenue will help us invest in our vital public services including the NHS, above and beyond the funding received from the UK Government.  At the same time, the majority of taxpayers in Scot* will still be paying less income tax than if they lived in the rest of the UK.

“Now that the new financial year has started, I’d also encourage people to check that the tax code is correct on the first payslip they get. If you think your tax code is wrong, you can check your details with HMRC who will be able to help.”

                        First Minister announces additional support for general practices in most deprived areas.
                    

People living in some of Scot*’s most deprived communities will benefit from an additional £1 million of funding to help tackle health inequalities.

The Inclusion Health Action in General Practice programme provides targeted funding for support to patients whose social circumstances have a negative impact on their health.

The funding is allocated directly to practices which are in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area and feature on the list of 100 most deprived practices in Scot*.

First Minister Humza Yousaf made the announcement as he visited the New Gorbals Health Centre in Glasgow.

The First Minister said:

“General practice is at the heart of our communities and is uniquely placed to deliver the care and support needed by patients who experience health inequalities.

“Of the one hundred poorest practices in the whole of Scot*, shockingly 81 currently sit within the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area – a statistic I am determined to change.

“This additional funding of £1 million will build on the foundations of previous funding. At a time when the cost of living crisis is widening health inequalities, this is an important step that supports our commitments to prevention and early intervention with patients at highest risk of poor health.”

Lorna Kelly, Chair of the Primary Care Health Inequalities Development Group said:

“The NHS needs to be at its best where it is needed the most, or health inequalities will continue to worsen.

“This additional resource to general practices serving the most deprived communities in Scot* is therefore very welcome.”

Background

Inclusion Health Action in General Practice funding of £300,000 in 2022-23 was provided to general practices in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with the highest levels of poverty and disadvantage.

IHAGP relates to recommendation from the Short Life Working Group on Health Inequalities in Primary Care report, published in March 2022, that the Scottish-Government provide general practices with increased resources targeted at deprivation. The intent of the recommendation was:

to address a gap between existing demand-led funding allocation processes and patient needs associated with inequality; and
 to act as a bridging mechanism between the current General Practice funding formula and any future funding model/approach which takes fuller account of deprivation.

                        Latest National and Official Statistics published.
                    

The latest poverty statistics, covering the period to March 2022, show little recent change in poverty levels for children, working-age adults and pensioners.
Two out of the four child poverty measures in the Child Poverty (Scot*) Act (relative and absolute poverty) are broadly stable. Persistent poverty is gradually increasing, and the material deprivation measure continues to be affected by the pandemic.
While the poverty risk is much lower for children where someone in the household is in paid work compared to those in workless households, not all work pays enough to lift the household above the poverty line. Over two thirds of children in poverty live in a household with someone in paid work.
Working-age adults and pensioners are less likely to be in poverty compared to children: 15% of pensioners and 21% of working-adults are in relative poverty after housing costs, compared to 24% of children. Poverty levels have been broadly stable for all age groups.
Adults under 25 are more likely to be in poverty than older adults. Minority ethnic households are more likely to be in poverty compared to white British households. Muslim adults are more likely to be in poverty compared to adults of Christian and other faiths and those with no religion. Some, but not all, of the higher poverty risk for minority ethnic groups and Muslims can be explained by their lower average age. Single adults, especially single parents, and those who are divorced or separated are more likely to be in poverty compared to married, cohabiting and widowed adults. People living in households with disabled household members are also more likely to be in poverty than those with no disabled household members.
Background
The two full statistical publications are available here:
Poverty and Income Inequality in Scot* contains statistics on poverty, child poverty, poverty risks for various equality characteristics, household income and income inequality for Scot*. This report also includes new statistics on household food security. The data comes from the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) Family Resources Survey, Households Below Average Income dataset. Comparable UK income and poverty figures are published on the same day by DWP.
Figures are presented as three-year averages of each estimate. Three-year estimates best identify trends over time. Single-year estimates are also available in the reference tables. The latest poverty and household income data in this report covers the period from April 2019 to March 2022.
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact on data collection and sample sizes. This resulted in more volatile estimates in the most recent period. In addition, data collected during the year between April 2020 and March 2021 was excluded from the most recent estimates as the data was not robust.
Persistent Poverty in Scot* presents estimates of the proportion of people in Scot* who live in persistent poverty. The data comes from the Understanding Society Survey, and the latest statistics cover the period from 2017 to 2021.
These poverty statistics are used by the Scottish-Government and other organisations to monitor progress in tackling poverty and child poverty, and to analyse what drives poverty and what works for tackling poverty and income inequality.
Official statistics are produced in accordance with the Code of Practice for Statistics.
Key poverty measures:
Relative poverty: A household is in relative poverty if its income is below 60 percent of the middle household income in the UK (the poverty threshold). Relative poverty is a measure of whether the income of the poorest households are keeping pace with middle income households across the UK
Absolute poverty: A household is in absolute poverty if its income is below the relative poverty threshold from 2010/11. This way, it measures whether the incomes of the poorest households are keeping pace with rising prices
Combined low income and material deprivation identifies the number of children in families that cannot afford basic essential goods and services because of a low income (below 70 percent of the middle household income)
Persistent poverty identifies the number of people in relative poverty for three or more out of four years. People who live in poverty for several years are affected by it through their lifetime
Household income is adjusted for household size.
The poverty publications present poverty figures before and after housing costs. Before housing costs figures are a basic measure of household income from earnings and benefits. After housing costs figures subtract spending on rents, mortgage interest payments and other unavoidable housing costs from this basic income. In Scot*, poverty statistics focus mainly on poverty after housing costs. The poverty estimates in this summary refer to relative poverty after housing costs.
Further information on income and poverty statistics within Scot* is available.            ",23/03/2023,Poverty levels broadly stable

                        Agenda for Change pay offer accepted by trade unions.
                    

Healthcare staff will begin to benefit from largest overall investment in Agenda for Change pay in a single year from next month, following unions’ unanimous agreement.
160,000 NHS staff – including nurses, midwives, paramedics, allied health professionals, porters and others – will receive an average 6.5% increase in pay in 2023-24.
This £568 million deal includes a commitment to deliver the most progressive package of terms and conditions reform in decades and support for workforce recruitment, sustainability and retention.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: 
“I am very pleased that the Agenda for Change trade unions have unanimously agreed to accept this pay offer, meaning staff will start seeing the benefits of this deal in their April pay packets.
“This £568 million deal that will ensure NHS Agenda for Change staff remain, by far and away, the best paid anywhere in the UK. We are also committed to delivering the most progressive package of terms and conditions reform in decades. 
“Our healthcare staff have shown how dedicated and hardworking they are time and again and I cannot thank them enough for their commitment, particularly over the last few challenging years. Our staff are the very backbone of the NHS and we are committed to supporting them, particularly during a cost of living crisis.
“I am grateful for the continued efforts to keep discussions going to reach this deal and that this has been able to be processed in time to get the money to staff so quickly.”
BACKGROUND
A total of £568 million has been committed for Agenda for Change pay in 2023-24. This equates to an average uplift of at least 6.5% for all staff at Band 8a and below.
All staff will also receive a one-off pro rata payment of between £387 and £939 depending on banding.
The offer also reaffirms previous commitments to work to reduce the working week, protect learning time and review band 5 job nursing profiles.
Examples of increases over the two years (2022-23 and 2023-24):
experienced porters (band 2) receive more than £3,750 extra (19.1%)

"
                    
                        Proposals ‘balance fairness with affordability and fiscal sustainability’.
                    

The framework for public sector pay increases in 2023-24 has been published, recognising the volatility of economic conditions while balancing the need for sustainable public services.
The new Public Sector Pay Strategy recommends public sector workers receive an increase of 3.5%, in line with the UK Government’s recommended pay rise for the public sector.
It sets a maximum pay uplift of 5% where there are justifying circumstances, suggests a £1,500 cash uplift for workers who earn £25,000 or less and commits to a review of Chief Executives’ pay.
Public bodies will be required to pay the real Living Wage at £10.90 per hour, including for internships and Modern Apprentices.
The strategy also maintains the Scottish-Government’s commitment to no compulsory redundancies in the public sector as well as the delivery of a public sector pilot for a four-day working week.
It also strongly encourages employers to standardise to a 35-hour working week and puts in place provisions for the ‘right to disconnect’, which would support people to switch off from work and enjoy their free time without being disturbed by emails, messages or calls during non-work hours.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said:
“This pay strategy focuses on making sure we balance fairness with affordability and sustainability of public finances while recognising the vital contribution of public sector workers in Scot*.
“The Scottish-Government sees fair public sector pay deals and a policy of no compulsory redundancies as a response to the cost of living crisis and the strategy continues to promote our progressive approach to pay by including cash uplifts for those on low incomes.
“At the same time, it recognises that organisations across the public sector, including the Scottish-Government, are subject to constrained funding and acknowledges the recurring impact of pay deals. This may mean public bodies need to take decisions on the size and shape of their workforce to ensure affordability in the medium-term. We expect this to be achieved through natural turnover and effective workforce planning.
“The Chancellor’s Spring Budget was silent on public sector pay, despite our calls for additional funding across the UK to support fair pay awards.
“The limited additional funding for the Scottish-Government did not go far enough so to fund public sector pay increases, we will have to find money from within our budget to invest in public services and provide fair, affordable and sustainable pay rises.”
Background
The 2023-24 Public Sector Pay Strategy
The pay strategy applies to around 52,000 staff in the Scottish-Government and its associated agencies and non-departmental public bodies, such as Scot*Enterprise and NatureScot. It also covers NHS senior management posts and all public appointments, including the Chairs of public bodies.
A full list of public bodies the strategy covers is available on the Scottish-Government’s website.
The strategy also acts as a reference point for other parts of the public sector workforce including NHS Scot*, fire-fighters and police officers, teachers and further education workers. For local government employees, pay and other employment matters are delegated to local authorities.            ",22/03/2023,Public sector pay strategy published

A fund that helps to tackle inequality and discrimination has supported more than 115,000 people in its first year.
The Scottish-Government’s Equality and Human Rights Fund is providing £21 million in grants over three years to 48 organisations working with diverse communities to further equality and protect human rights.
Funded initiatives include advice helplines, mental wellbeing sessions, English classes and benefits advice.
Equalities Minister Christina McKelvie visited the West of Scot* Regional Equality Council (WSREC) in Glasgow, to see how people have benefited from their work.
Ms McKelvie said:
“We want to build a fairer, more equal Scot* which is free from discrimination and where the human rights of everyone are respected, protected and fulfilled.
“I was very pleased to visit WSREC and see the range of activities that they deliver. For example, their cost of living advice service for people from minority ethnic communities has helped to boost family incomes and lift children out of poverty.
“WSREC is just one of 48 organisations that receive grants from the Equality and Human Rights Fund. From advocacy support to public education, these organisations are transforming the lives of the thousands of people that they work with.”
Ghzala Khan, Executive Director at WSREC, said:
“Based in Glasgow, the West of Scot* Regional Equality Council supports a range of minority ethnic communities across 12 local authorities.
""The Equality and Human Rights Fund has enabled us to deliver bi-lingual, culturally sensitive services to marginalised minority ethnic groups in the areas of advice and information, employability, direct discrimination, civic participation and health and wellbeing.
“Our work reduces inequality, increases opportunity, and supports people and families to achieve their full potential.""

                        DFM says Spring Budget falls short on vital lifelines.
                    

Deputy First Minister John Swinney has described the UK Government’s Spring Budget statement as “another missed opportunity” to help households, businesses and public services through the cost of living crisis.
He said Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt had failed to deploy the full range of powers available to him to mitigate the impact of soaring energy prices and high inflation.
While welcoming a number of individual measures such as the extension of the energy price guarantee – and with a typical household’s monthly energy bills set to rise by almost half from March to April – Mr Swinney said substantive actions such as restoring the Universal Credit uplift were notably absent.
He also called for the UK Government to inflation-proof the Scottish-Government’s budget so it can better co-ordinate spending across Scot*.
Mr Swinney said:
“This UK Budget is another missed opportunity to take meaningful action to lift families out of poverty, invest in our public services and help businesses so that our economy can grow.
“Instead, the UK Government should have taken more substantive action to increase the Scottish-Government’s budget so we can better align spending and deliver for people and organisations right across Scot*.
“While reversal of the planned increase in the energy price guarantee is welcome, with the end of the energy bills support payments, typical household monthly bills will still rise by more than half from March to April, at a time when wholesale energy costs are falling.
“Rising interest rates combined with reduced support means some people are expected to experience a larger fall in living standards this coming year than they have over the last 12 months.
“An uplift on Universal Credit and extending this to legacy benefits would have made a meaningful difference to households struggling to make ends meet.
“The limited additional money for the Scottish-Government’s Budget is welcome but will not go far enough and in the long-term our capital funding will fall in real-terms. Without extra funding, we will have to find money from within the Scot*Budget to invest in public services, provide fair pay rises and help people with the cost of living.
“The Scottish-Government is doing what it can with its limited powers to ensure people receive the help they need, but the UK Government’s could have done far more to ease the burden affecting so many, demonstrating yet again why Scot* needs the powers of independence.”
Background
In a letter to the Chancellor ahead of the Spring Budget, the Deputy First Minister had urged specific measures to help households, invest in public services and support the economy to grow - including reinstating the uplift to Universal Credit and providing tax incentives for businesses.
Ahead of the UK Budget, the Resolution Foundation estimated that typical incomes among non-pensioner households will fall by 4% in 2023-24 in real terms, compared to 3% in 2022-23.            ",15/03/2023,A ‘missed opportunity’ for meaningful action

The UK Government is being urged to invest in public services and deploy its full range of powers to tackle the cost of living crisis, supporting people and businesses.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney has written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt ahead of his Spring Budget to call for targeted support to help more families out of poverty by reinstating the uplift to Universal Credit, increasing it to £25 per week and extending it to means-tested legacy benefits.
He said vulnerable households should not have to bear the burden of soaring energy prices, and called for windfall tax revenues to fund much-needed support. Mr Swinney also pressed for support for struggling businesses to provide the certainty to invest and grow.

                        Uplift in bursaries and loan packages.
                    

Financial support available to undergraduate students will rise by £900 from the start of the 2023-24 academic year.
Estranged students in higher education and other undergraduate learners with the lowest household income will see their maximum support package increase from £8,100 to £9,000 per year, as the ceiling for all student loan applications is uplifted by £900.
The annual non-repayable Care Experienced Bursary for eligible higher education students will also increase to £9,000. In further education, a £900 increase will also be applied to the maximum bursary rate available to care experienced students.
These increases will be available to students already at college and university and for new students beginning their studies from Autumn 2023.
Students in need of immediate financial support for the 2022-23 academic year are still able to apply to their college or university for assistance through their Discretionary Funds.
Higher and Further Education Minister Jamie Hepburn said:
“This rise in support will help to alleviate the financial pressures facing many students as we grapple with the cost-of-living crisis.
“The maximum financial support package available to the most vulnerable students and those from the lowest household incomes in Higher Education will rise to £9,000. This is the next step in delivering our commitment to provide a total package of student support equivalent to the living wage.
“Increasing the Care Experienced Bursary will help more of Scot*’s Care Experience community to access further and higher education and fulfil their potential.”
Who Cares? Scot* CEO Louise Hunter said:
""It’s great to hear news of the £900 increase in financial support available to students in Scot*. I’m sure this will be welcomed by many students who are struggling to balance their education and finances during the cost-of-living crisis. Raising the Care Experienced Student Bursary to £9,000 per year responds to the specific challenges this group can face. For many Care Experienced people without family to rely on for support during their studies, they can face greater barriers in realising their lifelong right to education.
“We know that Care Experienced people are often disproportionality disadvantaged compared to their peers and in recognition of this Who Cares? Scot* will continue to fight for the rights of Care Experienced Students - as committed to within The Promise. This means we can ensure all members of our community are given the right support to thrive.”
BACKGROUND
The uplift will be applicable to higher education students receiving SAAS funding, including Scot*domiciled students studying elsewhere in the UK. The rise in financial support for further education students will only apply to those studying in Scot*.
The 2021 Programme for Government committed an ambitious reform to student financial support, including to expand our total student support package to reach the equivalent of the living wage.
The Scot*Funding Council will announce other bursary maintenance rates for further education students in due course.
Further details for support rates available to students in 2023-24 academic year will be available on the SAAS website from March 2023.            ",14/03/2023,Increased support for students

Crofters across Scot* will be able to apply for larger sums of money to upgrade their housing under the Croft House Grant.
To help ensure more crofters and their families can benefit, the government is increasing the grant rate for home improvements from 40% to 60% of the total project cost – with a maximum grant of £38,000.
The grant scheme also supports crofters to build new homes, allowing them to maximise the full potential of their crofts and to retain and attract people to remote and rural communities.
Last year the Scottish-Government awarded more than £850,000 in Croft House Grant funding to support 28 crofters and their families.
Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and Islands Mairi Gougeon said:
“Crofters are so important to our rural and island communities. They play an integral role contributing to the long-term sustainability of these often fragile areas.
“The Croft House Grant enables crofters to enjoy the full potential of their crofts while generating economic success - and I have seen first-hand the difference it can make.
“We must do all we can to attract and retain people in our crofting communities, particularly young families. That’s why we are committed to continuing and improving this vital support.”
Chief executive of the Scot*Crofting Federation Patrick Krause said:
“Housing and fuel poverty are major issues we face in rural Scot*, and, despite the soaring costs, we need more homes, homes that that are ecologically sound. So this is very welcome news.
""It is hearting to see Scottish-Government adding to a very effective scheme that has helped hundreds of families to get established, and particularly in helping with improvements to existing buildings, upgrading to be more environmentally efficient, extending and bringing older buildings back into use. It is a win for all.”
Background
Find out more about the Croft House Grant scheme and how to apply on the Scottish-Government's Rural Payments and Services website: Croft House Grant (ruralpayments.org)
Crofting tenure requires crofters to live within 32 kilometres of their croft and provide their own housing, so the Croft House Grant can assist crofters to meet their statutory duty.  There are four application rounds every year, March, June, September and December, and eligible applications are assessed using a scoring system, which is designed to target support at those who would not be able to build or improve their home without grant support.
Since the scheme was launched in 2007 more than £24.2 million has been awarded to over 1,100 families and individuals living and working in rural and island communities.             ",14/03/2023,More support for Scotland’s crofters

                        Emergency protections for tenants extended.
                    

Private rent increases will be capped at 3% and restrictions will remain on enforcement of evictions under measures approved today by MSPs.
The changes to the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Act will mean that from 1 April 2023:
If a private landlord chooses to increase a tenant’s rent mid-tenancy, the increase will be capped at 3%
Private landlords will alternatively be able to apply for a rent increase of up to 6% to help cover certain increases in costs in defined and limited circumstances
Enforcement of evictions will continue to be paused for up to six months except in a number of specified circumstances
Increased damages for unlawful evictions of up to 36 months’ worth of rent will continue to apply
These measures will be extended to 30 September, provided they remain necessary, with the option to extend for another six-month period if required.
As previously announced, the social sector rent freeze has been replaced with agreements from landlords to keep any rent increase for 2023-24 well below inflation. The rent cap for student accommodation is to be suspended, recognising its limited impact on annual rents set on the basis of an academic year.
Tenants' Rights Minister Patrick Harvie said:
“Our emergency legislation has given tenants across the rented sector additional protection as we continue to live through these challenging and uncertain economic times.
“It is clear that many households in the private rented sector in particular continue to struggle, which is why we are capping in-tenancy rent increases in the private sector at 3% from next month, with safeguards in place recognising the effects the cost of living crisis may have on some landlords. Our restrictions on evictions will continue across all sectors, with the social sector rent cap having been replaced with voluntary agreements from landlords to keep rents affordable.
“We will continue to keep these measures under review, ensuring they remain necessary and proportionate to the challenges at hand.”
Background 
The evictions moratorium pauses enforcement of eviction actions resulting from the cost of living crisis except in a number of specified circumstances. Evictions can be delayed for a maximum of 6 months while the measures are in force.
Landlords can apply to Rent Service Scot* (RSS) to increase rent to partially cover specific costs including increased mortgage interest payments on the property they are letting, an increase in landlords’ insurance or increases in service charges paid as part of a tenancy, subject to an overall limit. This limit is currently set at 3% of total rent. From 1 April the limit will be increased to 6%. In effect this retains the ability for landlords to raise rents at a level of 3% above the cap.
Under the agreement on social rents for 2023-24, COSLA has committed to keeping local authority rent increases to an average of no more than £5 a week. Members of the Scot*Federation of Housing Associations and Glasgow West of Scot* Forum of Housing Associations have reported planned increases averaging 6.1%.

                        John Swinney thanked for “support, wisdom and friendship”.
                    

Deputy First Minister John Swinney has announced he is leaving the Scottish-Government after nearly 16 years.  
He will stand down as Deputy First Minister once a new First Minister is appointed later this month and return to the backbenches. He is the longest serving Deputy First Minister on record, having held the post for almost nine years, and also served as Education Secretary and two tenures as Finance Secretary, latterly in an interim role.
In a letter to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Swinney says it has been an “honour to serve Scot*” and that he has always sought “to transform the life chances of everyone.”
In her reply, the First Minister pays tribute to Mr Swinney’s “deep care and attention to the wellbeing of our nation” and says she could not have wished for a better “partner in government”.
Background
Mr Swinney’s letter to the First Minister
It has been the privilege of my life to serve in the Scottish-Government since 2007 as a Cabinet Secretary with responsibility first for Finance and the Economy, then Education and Skills and finally Covid Recovery. It has been my honour to serve Scot* as your Deputy First Minister since 2014.
These have been demanding commitments to fulfil over nearly 16 years and I have decided that, when the First Minister is appointed later in March, I will stand down from government.
When I joined the Scot*National Party at the age of 15 in 1979, our political prospects were poor and I could scarcely have imagined that over so many years I would have the opportunity to serve Scot* in government in the way I have.
In all that I have undertaken in government, I have tried to listen carefully to different views and be open to the ideas and thoughts of people in Scot*. I have sought always to transform the life chances of everyone who lives here. I have acted to make Scot* a fairer, more prosperous and more confident country that I believe would be assured with Independence.
In all of that work, I have deeply valued the advice and professionalism offered to me by so many outstanding civil servants with whom I have had the privilege to work. They are a credit to their service. I have been touched constantly by the kindness of people in Scot* and their understanding of the many challenges with which we have to wrestle in Government. I am grateful to my ministerial and parliamentary colleagues for their collaboration and support. And I am indebted to you for your leadership, constancy, friendship and loyalty.
I will continue to faithfully represent my constituents in Perthshire North and look forward to sitting with you on the back benches of the Scot*Parliament to continue our contribution to Scot*’s cause.
Thank you for the opportunity you have given me to serve my country.
The First Minister’s reply
Thank you for your letter.
Your contribution to our nation, almost 16 years in government is considerable, indeed unique. Therefore, while I - perhaps more than most - completely understand your decision, I still felt a real sense of sadness when you told me of it.
As Finance and Economy Secretary in our newly formed Scottish-Government in 2007, you steered us successfully through budget after budget, laying the foundations for a long list of policy successes.
You were also the architect of a new partnership with local government, and helped negotiate a a new financial settlement with the UK Government, the Fiscal Framework, rebuffing in the process attempts to strip Scot* of funding.
As Education Secretary, you piloted reforms that are now delivering progress in our mission to close the attainment gap. You presided over an increase in teacher numbers and opened university education to record numbers of young people from the poorest backgrounds.
Perhaps most significantly for the long-term, you delivered the biggest expansion in early learning and childcare in our country’s history - a transformation that will change the lives of future generations of children for the better. I know you are as proud of this policy as I am - and rightly so.
Your role in Scot*’s recovery from Covid also merits special mention. From the darkest days of the first lockdown, you led our work on the ‘four-harms’ approach that guided exit from public health restrictions. From a more personal perspective, your friendship and wise counsel during the pandemic, which was by far the most challenging period of my tenure as First Minister, was invaluable and helped me through some really tough days.
You returned for a second, interim tenure as Finance Secretary just as UK Government mismanagement was causing calamity in the nation’s finances and economy. However, in the face of spiraling inflation, you focussed firmly on protecting the most vulnerable, tackling child poverty, addressing climate change and building sustainable public services. Bringing to bear all your experience of government – and the deep care and attention to the wellbeing of our nation that I know you feel – you helped protect thousands from the full impact of the cost of living crisis. Securing funding for the expansion of the game-changing Scot*Child Payment was the most important of many initiatives.
There is so much more that I could highlight. Over almost 16 years in government, more than eight years as Deputy First Minister – indeed, the longest serving Deputy First Minister so far – you have made countless contributions to the good of our people and our country.
In short, I could not have wished for a better partner in government than you, and there is no doubt that our Scottish-Government would have achieved much less had you not been in it.
Please accept my thanks for your support, wisdom and, above all, friendship as together with Ministers past and present, we sought to make Scot* a better place. As I said when I announced my own departure from office, serving as First Minister has been the privilege of my life - having done so with you by my side as Deputy First Minister has been an honour.
As for the future, I know you will continue to serve Scot* well and that you will be, as you always have been, a source of good advice and wise counsel to our party, government and movement. I look forward to this new phase - for both of us - as we move to the backbenches and make way for the new generation who will now lead Scot* forward.
With grateful thanks and friendship always.

                        £155 million in payments since introduction in February 2021
                    

There were 184,000 children and young people getting £25 per week in Scot*Child Payment by the end of 2022, latest statistics show. 
The figure includes 78,000 who have received it since the payment was extended to include children aged between six and 16 in November. 
Social Security Scot* had provided decisions to just over half the people who applied on the extension of the payment by the end of 2022.
Decisions for the majority of people who applied or added additional children to their award between 14 November and 31 December 2022 have now been issued and this will be reported on in the next round of statistics.
Scot*Child Payment was announced in the summer of 2019, with the first payments being made in February 2021.
Since then it has risen from £10 per week per child to £25 per week per child - a 150% increase in value.
It means that the amount paid out to children totals £155 million until the end of last year.
Ahead of extending Scot*Child Payment to under-16s, local authorities also made more than 1.1 million Bridging Payments across 2021 and 2022 to the families of school age children worth a total of £169.3 million.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said:
““These figures demonstrate our commitment to tackling child poverty and the significant financial support we have made available to meet that aim.
“This is just a snapshot of all the work being done since Scot*Child Payment was extended and increased until the end of 2022.
""We’ve since processed tens of thousands more applications.
“This represents remarkable progress in the delivery of the most ambitious child poverty reduction measure in the UK.
“That increased payment of £1,300 per child per year is now benefitting families across Scot*.
“We want to make sure that everyone gets the help available to them. Parents or carers who are on universal credit, tax credits or other benefits and who have children under 16 should check through Social Security Scot* if they are eligible.”
Background
Scot*Child Payment is part of a wider package of five family payments including: Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment, Best Start Grant Early Learning Payment, Best Start Grant School Age Payment and Best Start Foods
Best Start Grant Early Learning and School Age Payments are paid automatically to parents and carers who already receive Scot*Child Payment when their children become eligible.
The Scottish-Government estimates that the extended and increased payment could lift 50,000 children out of poverty in 2023/24, a reduction of five percentage points according to the most recent Scottish-Government forecasts issued in March 2022.
Families, and carers can find out more and apply at mygov.scot/scottishchildpayment or by calling Social Security Scot* free on 0800 182 2222
Families who already get Scot*Child Payment for a child under the age of six can add older children to their existing award. There is no cap on the number of children in one family who can receive Scot*Child Payment.
Social Security Scot* ran a marketing campaign to raise awareness of the payment tin January. It will run again in March. The Scottish-Government’s new cost of living website provides information and support for families: gov.scot/costoflivingsupport
Bridging Payments were introduced in 2021 ahead of the roll out of the Scot*Child Payment to under 16s. Families received up to £520 per eligible child in 2021 and will receive up to £650 in 2022. A final doubled payment was made to families in December 2022.
Where someone applied for Scot*Child Payment before 31 December 2022 and has not received a decision, we have been in contact as we require additional information or evidence to process their application.

                        £500,000 more for victims’ organisations.
                    

Organisations supporting victims and survivors of crime in Scot* will receive a £500,000 boost from a fund that takes money from offenders.
Seven organisations – including Victim Support Scot* and Survivors of Human Trafficking in Scot* – will share grant funding to provide practical help directly to victims.
This includes paying for emergency housing costs, meeting food, utility and clothing expenses, and helping with costs to repair or replace damaged property or goods and for mental health services such as counselling. 
It is the third tranche of payments from the Victim Surcharge Fund – which comes from the additional penalties imposed on offenders who receive a court fine – since its introduction in 2019.
To date, the Fund has helped more than 1,200 people affected by crime, with around £917,000 awarded  – a clear sign of how the Scottish-Government continues to prioritise victims.
Justice Secretary Keith Brown said: “It is absolutely right that criminals should pay towards helping victims of crime as they recover from their experience.
“Over the past five years we have invested £93 million through our justice budget to put victims' rights and needs at the centre of the criminal justice system, demonstrating our commitment to putting victims first.
“This latest funding we are awarding from the Victim Surcharge Fund will help people impacted by crime to access support when they need it most while enabling organisations such as Victim Support Scot* and Survivors of Human Trafficking in Scot* to provide even more help to victims and their families.”
Kate Wallace, CEO of Victim Support Scot* (VSS) said: “Confirmation of this funding means that VSS can continue this vital and life-changing support to people affected by crime and who have no other means of financial support.”
“The cost-of-living crisis has meant that more people affected by crime are struggling to make ends meet. Funding from the Victim Surcharge Fund allows VSS to provide essential items such as food vouchers, property repairs, alarms and funeral costs, thereby meeting the needs of vulnerable victims immediately following a crime.
“Since April 2020, VSS Emergency Assistance Fund has provided £903,000 worth of goods to 3,143 people and their families, funded in part through the Victim Surcharge Fund. We accept applications directly from people affected by crime and have received referrals from over 200 support organisations.”

Help with heating costs is on its way to around 400,000 people on low incomes through a new Scottish-Government benefit, with the first payments processed this week.
More than £20m will be paid out over the course of February and March in Winter Heating Payments.
Winter Heating Payment replaces the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) Cold Weather Payment. Unlike the DWP benefit it replaces, Winter Heating Payment is not paid only to people when there is a sustained period of cold weather in a specific location, but is a reliable annual £50 payment.
Those eligible for Winter Heating Payment will receive it automatically, with no need to apply. It is paid through Social Security Scot* and people will get a letter to let them know they are eligible.
Minister for Social Security Scot* Ben Macpherson said:
“Our new Winter Heating Payment is the thirteenth Scottish-Government benefit. This year it will provide 400,000 people most in need with a reliable, automatic £50 payment to help towards their heating costs.
“The Payment will reach significantly more people than the benefit it has replaced. On average only 185,000 people received the equivalent Cold Weather Payments from the UK Government over the last seven years - whereas we will pay everyone eligible every year.
""The Scottish-Government is investing around £20 million per year compared with an average of £8.3 million annually paid out through Cold Weather Payment. We will also uprate the next Winter Heating Payment by 10.1%, to £55.05.”            ",22/02/2023,"£20m to help 400,000 people with heating costs"

The Scottish-Government is providing £8.6 million in direct support for people affected by the UK benefit cap as part of its work to tackle child poverty.
An estimated 4,000 families with around 14,000 children are now able to apply for extra financial support through their local council’s Discretionary Housing Payments scheme.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said:
“We are increasing funding to help bridge the gap between what people need in benefits from the UK Government and what they actually receive. Eligible households could be £2,500 better off on average per year as a result.“We will spend up to £84 million in 2023-24 on Discretionary Housing Payments to mitigate not only the UK Government’s bedroom tax and the on-going freeze to Local Housing Allowance rates, but now also the benefit cap which is pushing families into hardship.“Our child poverty targets are ambitious and that is why we are choosing to invest significantly more in social security than the funding we receive from Westminster and helping to mitigate the damaging impact of UK Government welfare cuts.”John Dickie, Chair of the Child Poverty Action Group, said:“Mitigating the UK benefit cap is absolutely the right thing to do. Support for struggling families shouldn’t have an arbitrary limit that pushes children into deeper poverty.“It’s now vital that everyone affected by the benefit cap applies to their local authority for a Discretionary Housing Payment to replace as far as possible the cash support removed by the cap. The Scottish-Government has done the right thing, now the UK Government must act to scrap the cap altogether.”Laura Millar, Strategic Manager at charity Fife Gingerbread, which helps lone parents and families in need, said:“Last year Fife Gingerbread supported the ‘Scrap the Cap’ campaign calling on Westminster to end the benefit cap and the financial hardship this causes. Therefore, the Scottish-Government’s commitment to empower local authorities to mitigate the impacts of the benefit cap using Discretionary Housing Payments is a positive step.“Although the number of households affected across Scot* may be relatively small this is an important measure. The greatest risk is that households may be unaware of their entitlement, and every year millions of pounds of benefits go unclaimed. Therefore, we must all raise awareness of this announcement to ensure those most in need of support receive it.”BackgroundFunding for benefit cap mitigation by Scot*local authorities through Discretionary Housing Payments is as follows:

A Scot*Budget which goes further to support the vulnerable and deliver greater benefits than provided in the rest of the UK will be voted on in Parliament.
Ahead of Tuesday’s final debate and vote on the 2023-24 Scot*Budget Bill, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has set out the “social contract with every citizen of Scot*” – supporting people through the cost of living crisis with the groundbreaking Scot*Child Payment, the expansion of free school meals and free bus travel to more than two million people.
Against a background of high inflation and the cost of living crisis, record funding of more than £19 billion is committed to the Health and Social Care portfolio – an increase of over £1 billion. Other measures include more than £350 million for the Council Tax Reduction Scheme which sees 370,000 households paying no council tax, and for business the lowest non-domestic rate poundage in the UK will mean more than 95% of properties are liable for a lower property tax rate than elsewhere.
Investing in Scot*’s future with more than £4.6 billion for the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Portfolio, the Budget also includes £467 million to protect the natural environment.
Mr Swinney said:
“This Budget strengthens our social contract with every citizen of Scot* who will continue to enjoy many benefits not available throughout the UK.
“In one of the most challenging budgets since devolution, we are prioritising our limited resources to protect public services, invest in the transition to Net Zero and take decisive steps to eradicate child poverty in Scot*.
“Supporting people most in need in these difficult times is the foundation of this Budget. As a Government we are doing all we can to support people and families.
“We have chosen a distinctive, more progressive path where people are asked to pay their fair share to create the fairer society in which we all want to live. Progressive choices on Scot*Income Tax mean that next year this Government will deliver record funding of more than £19 billion for health and social care.
“While none of us should underestimate the scale of the ongoing financial challenges, I am confident that this Budget package offers stability and certainty for Scot*.”

A quarter of a million Baby Boxes have been delivered to expectant parents – providing them with more than £400 worth of essential items for their newborn.
The milestone was reached ahead of the popular scheme’s sixth anniversary in the summer.
Children’s Minister Clare Haughey said:
“The Baby Box is part of our commitment to ensure every child has the best start in life, and I am heartened that so many families have benefitted from this fantastic scheme.
“Clearly household budgets remain under extreme pressure from the cost of living crisis, so it is reassuring to know that all expectant parents in Scot*, regardless of their circumstances, have access to essential items needed for the first six months of their newborn’s life.
""The Baby Box also contains items to support positive parenting, benefitting infants as well as parents.”
One Parent Families Scot* Chief Executive Satwat Rehman said:
“With rising costs, single parent households are under increasing pressure to meet the costs of looking after their children. Having just one income, with costs associated with a newborn, is very difficult and the essentials contained within the Baby Box go a long way to easing that for single parents. We have seen first-hand how much difference this has made to the families we work with.”
Background
Scot*’s Baby Box provides families with a range of essential items for the first six months of their baby’s life, delivered in a sturdy cardboard box which can be used as a safe sleeping space during the early months. The contents of the box are designed to inform and support positive parenting behaviours.
APS Group (Scot*), which has the managing agent contract for Scot*’s Baby Box, conducted a cost analysis which determined that if parents were to buy the box and all the contents individually, the cost would be approximately £429.
In an independent evaluation, 97% of parents who took part in research rated the box and its contents as good.

A new campaign will encourage families living on a low income to access local support with finances and work.
It encourages people to take the first step towards relieving these pressures with help from the Parent Club website. This can guide them towards tailored support to help them improve their situation by starting work after unemployment, returning to work or improving earnings.
The campaign which includes TV, radio and online advertising, highlights the pressures of everyday life and shows parents feeling the ‘walls closing in’ on them as they juggle family life with bills and other costs.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said: 
“We understand the anxiety and stress, that low-income families could be living with and the impact of the cost-of-living crisis is likely to be making even worse.
“Parent Club can guide people to free and confidential tailored advice from local authority employment services, where they can access support relevant to their own work and family situation.
“It also offers information on how to get help from the Money Talk Team who can advise on areas such as maximising income and dealing with debt. Parent Club also provides sources of support with mental health and stress. 
“Tackling child poverty is our national mission. We want to make sure parents know what help is out there and claim any support they should be getting.” 
Chair of Dundee’s Discover Work Partnership Simon Hewitt said:
“Parental Employment Support empowers parents to progress towards new or improved employment.  The support is delivered in Dundee by ENABLE Works, Barnardo’s, One Parent Families Scot* and Volunteering Matters, with each organisation bringing their own specialist knowledge and experience.
“Parents can access a variety of support including financial and benefit advice, childcare options, careers guidance, work placements, training and upskill funds, and on-going support from a trained mentor.  Support can also be provided to employers to discuss and agree family friendly approaches. 
“Dundee’s Parental Employment Support is part of our wider Discover Work Service, which provides a range of employability support for all local customers.”
Citizens Advice Scot* CEO Derek Mitchell said:
“When times are difficult it can be easy to feel overwhelmed by bills mounting up - but our advice is free, confidential, and impartial.
“The Citizens Advice network is working with the Scottish-Government to deliver the Money Talk Team service. We can check to see what payments you might be missing out on or any cheaper deals are available to you. If you are struggling with debt we can help with that too.

                        £568 million for Agenda for Change (AfC) pay deal in 2023/24.
                    

Healthcare staff across Scot* have been offered the largest pay package in the history of the NHS, with a £568 million increase in investment.
160,000 NHS Agenda for Change staff – including nurses, midwives, paramedics, allied health professionals, porters and others – will be offered an average 6.5% increase in pay in 2023/24.
This pay offer includes the commitment to deliver the most progressive package of terms and conditions reform in decades. 
The offer also includes the commitment to modernising Agenda for Change, which was introduced nearly 20 years ago, to support workforce recruitment, sustainability and retention.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: 
“We have engaged extensively with trade union representatives over recent weeks, leaving no stone unturned to reach an offer which responds to the key concerns of staff. Our healthcare staff have shown how dedicated and hardworking they are time and again and I cannot thank them enough for their commitment, particularly over the last few challenging years.
“Over the two years of this £1 billion of increased investment in NHS Agenda for Change, a newly qualified nurse would see their pay increase by 15.8%, and experienced nurses at the top of band 5 would see their pay improve by over £4,700.
“This ensures that Scot*’s NHS Agenda for Change staff are, by far and away, the best paid anywhere in the UK. In fact, for NHS England to catch-up with Scot* the UK Government would need to offer increases in 2023/24 of over 14% at the top of band 5, over 13% at the top of band 6, and over 12% at the top of band 7.
“We have taken difficult decisions to find this money within the health budget because we know that our staff are the very backbone of the NHS and we are committed to supporting them, particularly during a cost of living crisis. I am grateful for the continued efforts around the table and that the trade unions will now put this to their members.""
BACKGROUND
A total of £568 million has been committed for Agenda for Change pay in 2023/24. This equates to an average uplift of at least 6.5% for all staff at Band 8a and below.
All staff will also receive a one-off pro rata payment of between £387 and £939 depending on banding.
The offer also reaffirms previous commitments to work to reduce the working week, protect learning time and review band 5 job nursing profiles.
Examples of increases over the 2 years (2022/23 and 2023/24):
experienced porters (band 2) receive more than £3,750 extra (19.1%)
experienced healthcare support workers (band 4) receive more than £4,000 extra. experienced AHPs (band 5) receive more than £4,700 extra (14.4%)
experience paramedics (band 6) receive more than £5,360 extra (13.2%)
experienced advance nurse practitioners (band 7) receive more than £5,900 extra (12.4%)

                        £27 million to tackle disadvantage.
                    

Community projects tackling poverty and disadvantage will receive £27 million funding over the next three years.
Food pantries which help lower food bills and cost of living advice services are among the 100 initiatives developed by local people set to receive grants from the Investing in Communities Fund.
Each supported project is delivering multiple activities, including:
debt and benefit advice to avoid electricity and gas disconnection or eviction for rent arrears in South East Glasgow
a furniture reuse scheme in Inverness and a swap and repair shop in West Lothian
community food growing in South West Glasgow
school uniform exchanges and supporting parents into employment in South Lanarkshire
help for mothers establishing micro businesses in South West Edinburgh
training for jobseekers and counselling to address mental health and substance abuse issues in the Borders
Community Wealth Minister Tom Arthur said:
“This fund will help directly address issues facing disadvantaged communities, such as unemployment and food insecurity.
“We have been clear that the Scot*Budget is prioritising our limited resources to tackle child poverty, invest in our transition to net zero, and protect public services. And the projects supported through Investing in Communities speak to these priorities.
“Many will help ease immediate challenges from the cost of living crisis but also support communities in delivering longer term plans to address poverty.”

                        Natural Beauty, Tourism and Governance score highly in new survey.
                    

Scot* has achieved its highest ever reported score in an international survey which asks 60,000 adults from 20 countries what their perceptions are of 60 nations.
The Nation Brands Index (NBI) 2022 survey scores and ranks countries across six dimensions including Culture, Tourism, Governance, Immigration and Investment, Exports, and People.
Scot*’s overall score has jumped to 65.3 out of 100, compared to 62.6 out of 100 in 2020, which is the highest score the Scottish-Government has reported since first subscribing to the survey in 2008.
Scot*’s natural beauty was ranked 7th out of 60, while Tourism ranked 12th out of 60. Tourism also scored the highest, jumping from 68.7 out of 100 in 2020 to 72.3 in 2022.  Compared to participating countries, Scot* ranked highly in key areas including ranking 9th for welcoming people, 10th for international peace and security and historic buildings and monuments.
The scoring and ranking of overall Governance has also improved, increasing from 62.9 in 2020 to 64.9 in 2022 and from 13th to 11th place.
Culture Secretary Angus Robertson said:
“Scot* is blessed with natural beauty, vibrant cities, rich historical sites, white sand beaches and rolling hills, and it is great to see everything we have to offer being recognised by citizens from across the world. It is also encouraging to see that governance in Scot* has also scored well internationally which might be due to international interest in forward thinking and outward looking Scottish-Government policies such as the baby box, free period products and our ambitious work to help tackle climate change
“Despite Scot*’s score improving to its highest since we first subscribed to the survey, we will continue to look at ways we can make things better for the people who live here. It’s been challenging in recent years with the impacts still being suffered from Brexit, the ongoing pandemic and the current cost of living crisis. The survey shows some areas that we can work on and the Scottish-Government will leave no stone unturned in doing so.”
Background
The survey was conducted by Anholt-Ipsos polling between 5 July and 11 August 2022.
Twenty panel countries were selected for the survey of the 2022 Nation Brands Index study, representing major developed and developing countries that play important and diverse roles in international relations, trade and the flow of business, and cultural and tourism activities.

                        Funding will help tackle social impact of rising cost of living.
                    

Projects supporting people most at risk of social isolation and loneliness will receive a share of almost £1 million support funding announced today.
The money will help to provide warm spaces, hot meals, group activities and fuel payments to people most at risk of isolation including older people, young parents, carers and disabled people.
Organisations to receive grants/funds include Age Scot*, who will continue to deliver their ‘Keeping The Doors Open’ grants programme, and Chest, Heart and Stroke Scot* who are recruiting Urdu and Punjabi-speaking volunteers to make Kindness Calls.
Equalities and Older People’s Minister Christina McKelvie said:
“Social isolation and loneliness can affect anyone, especially at this time of year when people can struggle to get outside and socialise. The pandemic and the cost of living crisis have increased isolation for some people, including young people, carers and disabled people.
“The funding will be a lifeline for a range of organisations who are helping to keep people connected during this challenging time.
“This fund is just one of the many crucial steps that we are taking to tackle social isolation and loneliness as part of our plan, A Connected Scot*.”
Chest, Heart & Stroke Scot*’s Chief Executive Jane-Claire Judson said:
“We know that living with a disability or long-term condition can be hugely isolating and that for those who are unable to read or communicate fluently in English, this isolation can be even more significant.
“This funding from the Scottish-Government will greatly enhance the ability of our support services to reach non-English speaking and minority ethnic populations in Scot* to reduce isolation and loneliness.
“Ultimately, it will allow us to engage with and support more people across Scot* who are living with chest, heart and stroke conditions, better enabling them to live their lives to the full.”
Chief Executive of Age Scot* Mark O’Donnell said
“Older people’s groups have an incredibly important role in communities across Scot*, supporting health and wellbeing, physical activity, tackling loneliness and food insecurity. Our research has identified that around 200,000 over-65s rely on groups like this but the impact of Covid-19 and spiralling inflation has meant that these lifelines have been facing incredible pressures to keeping their doors open. We’re incredibly grateful that the Scottish-Government took notice of our research and our ask of greater financial support for older people’s groups.
“The funding will help many such groups and clubs meet the rising cost of energy bills, food, transport and venues to meet, ensuring that their members can stay connected and are able to be as well as they can be.”

                        Non-Domestic Rates legislation.
                    

New draft legislation on non-domestic rates (NDR) aims to tackle tax avoidance and promote the Scottish-Government’s ground-breaking Deposit Return Scheme.
Regulations laid before the Scot*Parliament will empower councils to crack down on tax-avoidance such as the artificial use of insolvency, leasing arrangements or shell companies.
They would also make owners of non-domestic properties liable for payment, rather than the property’s occupiers, and allow for liability for payment to be backdated if an offence is repeated within a five-year period.
In a separate move, parts of properties solely used to house reverse vending machines, which refund users for recycling drinks containers, would be exempt from NDR. This will support businesses to get ready for Scot*’s Deposit Return scheme.
Further amendments to NDR, announced in the Scot*Budget 2023-24, will be published shortly as part of a package of regulations to provide more help for businesses through the current cost of living crisis.
Public Finance Minister Tom Arthur said:
“The Scottish-Government is committed to a fair and transparent system of non-domestic rates which supports businesses and communities.
“It is important that everyone pays their share and these regulations will help tackle those who seek to find loopholes to avoid payment.
“We want to ensure that parts of properties used for reverse vending machines are not liable to pay rates. This will incentivise and promote Scot*’s Deposit Return Scheme which will launch on 16 August this year.
“Subject to the regulations passing in the Scot*Parliament, we will work to ensure Scot*’s non-domestic rates system remains progressive and in line with our net zero ambitions.”
Background
The Non-Domestic Rates (Miscellaneous Anti-Avoidance Measures) (Scot*) Regulations 2023 will deliver on a commitment in the Bute House Agreement to help local authorities tackle tax avoidance tactics, including when they make decisions on applying empty property relief and charity relief.
The Non-Domestic Rating (Valuation of Sites of Reverse Vending Machines) (Scot*) Regulations 2023 will ensure the part of a non-domestic property used solely in the provision or use of a reverse vending machine, is not liable for rates.
The Scot*Budget 2023-24 announced the lowest poundage in the UK for the fifth year in a row and a package of reliefs worth an estimated £744 million.
Draft regulations are laid in order to be considered by Parliament before they are signed into law. These new regulations should come into force in Scot* on 1 April 2023.
Scot*’s Deposit Return Scheme, the first of its kind in the UK, will launch on 16 August 2023. It will be a major part of the Scottish-Government’s efforts to reduce littering and cut emissions by creating return points for recycling drinks containers.

                        Survey launched to understand international interests and aspirations.
                    

A public survey to help develop an International Culture Strategy for Scot* has been launched by the Culture Secretary.
The survey seeks views from cultural organisations, companies from across the creative industries and individuals who work internationally or have aspirations to do so. The strategy aims to develop an approach to international engagement that supports sectoral resilience, recovery and long term development.
The strategy will seek to draw on the knowledge, expertise and lived experience of cultural organisations and practitioners to understand the importance of international activity to their work and to the wider sector in Scot*.
The survey will be open for responses for three months and will form the basis of a report that will be published after a period of analysis.
Culture Secretary Angus Robertson said:
“Working in partnership with the sector, the Scottish-Government is developing an International Culture Strategy that supports the international aspirations and potential of Scot*’s culture sector, building on its strong existing international footprint.
“The strategy will be set in the context of the challenges facing the sector following the impact of Brexit, the Covid pandemic and the cost of living crisis and ensure it helps address these challenges. That is why this survey is so important as once we begin to see themes emerging, we can engage further with the sector to explore these themes in more detail.
“Scot*’s cultural activity has a strong international reputation, which is important to our wider international presence. I hope as many people and organisations as possible engage with this survey to allow us to create a strategy that best supports the sector’s international activity and ambitions.”

                        Scot*Budget 2023-24 reaches Stage One vote.
                    

Deputy First Minister John Swinney is urging MSPs to back the Scottish-Government’s Budget for 2023-24, as it “delivers for the people of Scot*”.
Speaking ahead of today’s Stage One Budget Bill debate, Mr Swinney said that in a difficult financial environment the Budget focused resources on the three key priorities of delivering sustainable public services, transforming the economy to deliver a just transition to net zero and taking direct action to eradicate child poverty.
It includes more than £13 billion for health and social care and £1 billion for early learning and childcare provision.
It also supports those hardest hit by the cost of living crisis, with £442 million invested in the unique Scot*Child Payment and £20 million for the Fuel Insecurity Fund to help households at risk of self-disconnection or self-rationing their energy use.
Mr Swinney said:
“These are fair and ambitious spending plans for the coming year which have been developed during one of the most challenging financial environments since devolution.
“To govern is to choose and we have chosen a different, distinctive path that commits substantial resources to protect the most vulnerable from the impact of decisions made by the UK Government.
“We are asking people to contribute to a fairer society that provides benefits such as free prescriptions, free access to higher education and concessionary travel not available in other parts of the UK.
“The progressive choices we propose on Scot*income tax also mean that next year the Scottish-Government can direct additional investment towards our NHS. That investment will help drive forward our recovery plan, improve primary health care services and help reduce the harms associated with drugs and alcohol.
“At the same time, the majority of people in Scot* will still be paying less in Income Tax than if they lived in the rest of the UK. The Budget also delivers the number one ask of businesses by freezing the non-domestic rates poundage and providing a package of reliefs worth an estimated £744 million.
“Our spending plans will help ensure we can deliver a net zero future achieved through sustainable economic growth. We are investing £1.4 billion to maintain, improve and decarbonise Scot*’s rail network and almost £467 million on peatland restoration. And by doubling the budget for the next phase of the Just Transition Fund to £50 million, we are helping regional economies in the North East and Moray move away from the industries contributing to the climate emergency and diversify into others.

                        550 disabled people supported to access Scot*social security benefits.
                    

A free independent advocacy service to support disabled people to access Scottish-Government benefits has marked its first year in operation.
The Scottish-Government is investing more than £20 million to deliver this service over the course of four years. This independent service is available to people with a disability who may need extra support. This could include people with a sensory disability, mental health condition or learning disability. The service is also available to parents or carers who need support to access benefits for a child.
The service, which was introduced in January 2022, enables disabled people to be more involved in the processes and decisions which affect them and advocates will provide the most appropriate form of support to each individual based on their circumstances.
Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
“I am delighted that, in its first year, the Independent Advocacy Service has supported over 550 people applying for Scottish-Government social security benefits.
“The service is a key part of our human rights approach to social security and how the values of dignity, fairness and respect in our social security system work in practice.
“The service helping disabled people to access the financial support they are entitled to, and is delivering on our commitment to make our system as inclusive as possible.
“With the Scottish-Government’s commitment to invest more than £20 million in it, the advocacy service will be able to assist even more disabled people access the help they are entitled to over the coming years.”
CEO of VoiceAbility, Jonathan Senker said:
“Over our first year of delivering the Independent Advocacy Service, people tell me that it enabled them to apply for social security benefits when before they felt daunted by the process. They say that advocates supported them to express themselves openly, when previously they felt obliged to ‘put on a brave face’ or underplay their needs.
“It’s vital that people can access the benefits to which they are entitled. I am proud of VoiceAbility’s skilled team of advocates, who are ready and available to support disabled people across Scot*. I encourage anyone who thinks an advocate could help them to access benefits to contact us. We’re here on the phone, online and in-person to make sure you’re heard when it matters.”
Background
The service was introduced in January 2022, ahead of a pilot for Adult Disability Payment – which replaces Personal Independence Payment (PIP) in Scot*. Adult Disability Payment was introduced across Scot* in August 2022.
The service is independent of the Scottish-Government and is delivered by VoiceAbility, a charity with 40 years’ experience of delivering independent advocacy services.
The service provides free advocacy to anyone who self-identifies as disabled who requires support to engage effectively with Social Security Scot*.
Advocacy is available throughout the whole of the process for seeking support; from the point of application, through to any request for redetermination and appeals.
People can access this support by contacting VoiceAbility directly for free on 0300 303 1660 or by visiting voiceability.org
People can also access this support by calling Social Security Scot* for free on 0800 182 2222 and asking to be referred to the Independent Advocacy Service.            ",26/01/2023,Independent Advocacy Service celebrates one year anniversary

                        Campaign aims to help fill vacant posts.
                    

A marketing campaign to support the recruitment of more adult social care workers has launched this week, to help address the high level of vacancies in the sector.
The campaign – titled ‘there is more to care than caring’ - will raise awareness of the career opportunities available in adult social care and encourage people to apply. Activity includes radio, outdoor and digital advertising, highlighting the important work done by adult social care workers.
It is part of the Scottish-Government’s commitment to attract more people to work in adult social care, retain existing staff and raise its status as a profession. This builds on a pay uplift for all adult social care staff which guarantees them a minimum of at least £10.90 an hour from this April.
Today, Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart visited Leuchie House, in North Berwick to see the work it does to support people affected by stroke, multiple sclerosis and neurological conditions.
Mr Stewart said:
“Working in adult social care can be challenging but offers the opportunity to have a hugely positive impact on people’s lives on a daily basis.
“We are increasing pay, improving terms and conditions in the sector, and developing clear career pathways for the workforce, ahead of the introduction of the National Care Service. This will lead to more rewarding roles for the existing adult social care workforce, and for new entrants to the profession.
“This campaign highlights that while relevant experience can help, it is core interpersonal skills such as communication, compassion, empathy and respect that are most highly valued. If these are skills you possess then adult social care could be the career for you.”
Background
Leuchie House, is a respite centre in North Berwick. Leuchie House which supports people with Multiple Sclerosis, who have had a stroke, or who are living with different neurological conditions, by providing essential short breaks for them. The centre also provides breaks for their guests’ carers or family members, either by taking on their caring responsibilities while they are at Leuchie House, or enabling them to have a break separately while their loved one is staying there.
The total cost of the campaign is £500,000 which includes media, production, PR and partnerships.

                        Minister urges people to check eligibility for support.
                    

People struggling to pay their council tax during the cost of living crisis are being encouraged to check if they are eligible for money off their bill.
The Council Tax Reduction (CTR) scheme is unique to Scot* and helps people on low incomes save an average of £750 a year on their council tax bill. Those eligible can also save up to 35% on their water and waste charges.
The latest figures published by the Scottish-Government show 455,220 recipients received CTR in November 2022, meaning around one-in-five households were benefitting from the scheme.
Public Finance Minister Tom Arthur visited Citizens Advice and Rights Fife today (Wednesday 25 January) to meet staff advising people on dealing with the cost of living crisis. He said:
“We know that this cost of living crisis is hammering people on lower incomes and those already living in poverty. It is vital that people know where to go to get advice and support.
“The Council Tax Reduction scheme will celebrate its tenth anniversary in April and Scot*households have saved more than £3 billion on their council tax since it was introduced. The support it provides has never been more important and I urge people to check whether they are eligible.
“Information can be obtained from your local Citizens Advice Bureau – like the excellent facility I visited in Glenrothes today – local councils and the Money Talk Team service promoted by the Scottish-Government, as well as online.”
Chief Executive Officer of Citizens Advice and Rights Fife, David Redpath, said:
“We are experiencing unprecedented demand for advice on how to maximise incomes to the cost of living crisis.
“Council Tax Reduction plays a key role in making budgets stretch further and we encourage people to check if they are eligible for a reduction, discount or even an exemption from paying council tax.
“Citizens Advice and Rights Fife is here to help people find ways to ease the cost of living whether that is council tax or any other daily living costs.”
Background:
The Council Tax Reduction scheme assesses a household’s income, capital and circumstances so is open to all, including people not in receipt of benefits.
People can check whether they are eligible for CTR through mygov.scot or by contacting their local council. Details of other help available including extra financial support or help with things like food, heating and electricity can be found on the Scottish-Government’s cost of living crisis support website.

                        Minister confirms intention to cap rents at 3%.
                    

Emergency measures to protect tenants will be extended, Tenants Rights’ Minister Patrick Harvie has confirmed, with private rents capped and enforcement of evictions prevented in most cases. 
Subject to the approval of Parliament, changes to the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Act will mean that from 1 April 2023: 
If landlords choose to increase private rents they will be capped at 3%
The safeguard for private landlords will be amended, allowing them to apply for increases of up to 6% to help cover certain increases in costs in defined and limited circumstances
Enforcement of evictions will continue to be prevented for all tenants except in a number of specified circumstances
Increased damages for unlawful evictions of up to 36 months’ worth of rent will continue to be applicable
The rent cap for student accommodation will be suspended, recognising its limited impact on annual rents set on the basis of an academic year
These temporary measures are intended to be extended to 30 September, provided they remain necessary, with the option to extend for another six-month period if required. 
As announced in December 2022, the social sector rent freeze is being replaced with agreements from landlords to keep any rent increase for 2023-24 well below inflation. 
Mr Harvie said: 
“Our emergency legislation has helped protect tenants facing the cost of living crisis. With many households still struggling with bills, it is clear that these protections are still needed to give tenants greater confidence about their housing costs and the security of a stable home. 
“While the primary purpose of the legislation is to support tenants, I recognise that costs have been rising for landlords too. That’s why we intend to allow those in the private sector to increase rents by up to 3%, with a continued safeguard allowing them to apply for larger increases to cover specified rising costs they might be seeing as landlords. By allowing increases in rent – capped well below inflation and limited to once per 12 months – we can continue protecting tenants from the minority of landlords who would impose unaffordable rent hikes. 
“We will continue to carefully monitor the impacts of this legislation, working with tenants and landlords to protect them from this costs crisis.” 
Background 
Further information on the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Act is available on the Scottish-Government website.
The evictions moratorium prevents enforcement of eviction actions resulting from the cost of living crisis except in a number of specified circumstances. 
Landlords can apply to Rent Service Scot* (RSS) to increase rent to partially cover specific costs including increased mortgage interest payments on the property they are letting, an increase in landlords’ insurance or increases in service charges paid as part of a tenancy, subject to an overall limit. This limit is currently set at 3% of total rent. From 1 April it will be increased to 6%. In effect this retains the status quo of allowable rent rises of 3% above the cap. As set out in the first report on the Act to the Scot*Parliament, as at 31 December 2022 RSS had received only 12 applications of this nature, of which 10 were valid. 
Under the agreement on social rents for 2023-24, COSLA has committed to keeping local authority rent increases to an average of no more than £5 a week. Members of the Scot*Federation of Housing Associations and Glasgow West of Scot* Forum of Housing Associations have reported planned increases averaging 6.1%.

                        Pragmatic approach to support hosts during cost of living crisis.
                    

Recognising the pressures short-term lets hosts face at this time, legislation has been laid to extend the deadline for applying for a licence by six months to 1 October 2023.
The new deadline applies to anyone operating as a host before 1 October 2022. Anyone who started operating after that must have applied for and obtained a licence before accepting guests and bookings.
Housing Secretary Shona Robison said:
“We are taking a pragmatic approach to help support hosts in recognition of the wider cost of living crisis that is placing pressure on businesses. This one-off six-month extension will give businesses more time to spread the cost of the licence fee, and meet the scheme requirements.
“The principal component of our licencing scheme is a mandatory set of safety standards which many hosts will already be meeting as a matter of best practice or compliance with existing law. Our scheme gives local authorities the powers to strike a balance between the economic and tourism benefits of short-term lets and community concerns.
“Many hosts have already applied for a licence. I encourage those that have yet to do so to apply for a licence well in advance of the extended deadline.”
Background
New hosts must now apply for, and obtain, a licence before accepting bookings or receiving guests. Anyone who operating as a host before 1 October 2022 can operate as normal while their application is being determined.
In December 2022 the Housing Secretary issued a letter to the Housing and Planning Committee confirming the intentions to amend the deadline of the scheme in the new year.

                        Cash-first approach will help those facing hardship.
                    

Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison has announced an additional £2.4 million in funding to help people struggling to afford food and other essentials.
The funds will go to four organisations to distribute mainly on a ‘cash-first’ basis to people in immediate need in the face of the cost of living crisis.
A focus on crisis payments and shopping cards will allow people to choose for themselves what they need.
Ms Robison announced the funding on a visit to Prospect Community Housing in Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, where she heard how staff are helping residents through debt and income advice services.
She said:
“I know people are struggling with the cost of food and other essentials right now, and this additional funding will get more support to some of those who need it most this winter.
“We are working with partners to prioritise urgent cash-first action when it comes to food insecurity and this will take some of the pressure off food banks.
“This funding has the potential to directly reach 7,500 people, and many more will benefit than this, as the Corra Foundation and Fareshare will between them distribute it further to an estimated 900 organisations.
“We want people to make sure they are getting all the support they are entitled to, so I encourage anyone who is struggling financially to get advice on what support they may qualify for - through their local authority, a local advice service, or Social Security Scot* as well as checking out our cost of living website.”
Carolyn Sawers, Chief Executive at the Corra Foundation said:
“This £1 million contribution to the Household Hardship Fund from the Scottish-Government provides a dignified cash first approach for those most impacted by the cost of living.
“Organisations which have received money through the fund have told us it is making a significant difference helping families with the essentials of food, fuel, and household items.
“Corra is committed to working alongside others in tackling the long-term issues of poverty. The Household Hardship fund is an important step in responding to the crisis that people across Scot* face today.”
Sally Thomas, Chief Executive of the Scot*Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA), said:
“Housing associations and co-operatives are doing everything they can to help tenants keep their heads above water, heat their homes and put food on their table this winter. However  our members are increasingly reporting that tenants are facing impossible decisions on and between household bills and food as costs soar.
“It’s simply not right that anyone in Scot* should be going hungry this winter. As we continue to face this unprecedented crisis, this money will be critical to helping ensure social landlords can provide a response to food insecurity that is tailored to the needs of their tenants and communities, maintaining dignity and choice.”
Background 
Allocations from the £2.4 million:
£1,000,000 to the Scot*Federation of Housing Associations for cash-first responses to food insecurity via their members
£1,050,000 to Corra Foundation for their Household Hardship Fund, providing grants to organisations working to alleviate poverty with an emphasis on cash-first responses food insecurity
£100,000 to Citizens Advice Scot* to expand their shopping card pilot, offering an alternative to a food bank referral
£250,000 to FareShare for regional purchasing where needed to supplement the supply from surplus and donations
In 2022-23 the Scottish-Government has allocated around £3 billion in a range of measures which will help mitigate the impacts of the cost of living crisis on households, of which £1 billion is for support only available in Scot* and not elsewhere in the UK.
The Scottish-Government consulted on a draft plan on ending the need for food banks between October 2021 and January 2022, and the plan will be published in the coming months.

                        Money could be available to help get through the cost of living crisis
                    

People are being encouraged to check they are not missing out on money and to find out if they could be eligible for any of the 12 benefits administered by Social Security Scot*. Seven of these are only available in Scot*.
The benefits which have been introduced over the past four years are available to people on low incomes responsible for children under 16, for people who need help paying for a funeral, disabled people, carers, young people entering the workplace and to help heat their homes.
Four of these payments are made automatically to people who get other qualifying benefits. To make sure people are maximising their income they should check what DWP benefits they could be eligible for too.
Payments made automatically include Carer’s Allowance Supplement and Child Winter Heating Payment as well as Best Start Grant Early Learning Payment and Best Start Grant School Age Payment for those in receipt of Scot*Child Payment.
In addition, the new Winter Heating Payment will be paid automatically to an expected 400,000 people across Scot* when it is introduced in February.  
Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
“January is traditionally a month where people find it harder financially than the rest of the year. This pressure can be more acute for people on low incomes or who face additional costs due to a disability or ill-health condition. The cost of living crisis also means that people are facing difficult financial decisions day in and day out.
“We are committed to making sure that people are getting all of the money that they are entitled to. That is why we are making payments automatically where we can. Where people need to apply, we are working hard to promote these payments and make the process of accessing them as straightforward as possible.
“Social Security Scot* works with partners and through advertising to promote our benefits and our next campaign will start this month to encourage parents and carers to apply for Scot*Child Payment.
“People can apply for all our benefits online, by phone, through the post or in person – whatever works best for them. We’ve designed the way we promote and deliver these benefits with the people who they are for to make sure that what we do works for them.
“We want people to talk with others they know about the support that is available. These payments are a shared investment in building a fairer society and no one should think twice about accessing what they are entitled to. Please look into what is available and apply if you think you could be eligible.”

Professor John McKendrick has been appointed as the new Commissioner for Fair Access to Higher Education in Scot*.
Currently Professor of Social Justice at Glasgow Caledonian University, he will work across Scot*’s education system to champion increased representation at university for students from the country’s most deprived areas.
Prof McKendrick succeeds Prof Sir Peter Scott who stepped down as Scot*'s inaugural Commissioner for Fair Access last year after six years in the role.
The Scottish-Government is committed to ensuring that students from the 20% most deprived communities will represent 20% of entrants to Scot*universities by 2030, and steady progress has been made towards this in recent years.
Minister for Higher Education, Further Education, Youth Employment & Training Jamie Hepburn said:
“I would like to thank Peter Scott for his tireless hard work and effort during his time as Commissioner. I have no doubt that Prof McKendrick will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the role, alongside a strong passion for widening access to higher education.
""More students from our most deprived areas are attending university than ever before – we have already exceeded the first interim target to have 16% of all entrants to Scot*universities from the 20% most deprived areas.
""This progress is extremely encouraging, but we know we have more to do. Prof McKendrick’s appointment provides an excellent opportunity to continue to drive progress on fairer access to higher education for all at such a pivotal juncture.”
Prof McKendrick said:
""It is a great honour to be appointed Commissioner for Fair Access and I relish the opportunity of working with those committed to tackling inequalities in access.
""Progress has been made toward meeting the ambitious 2030 target to widen access, but the world in which we live has changed. The Covid pandemic and now the cost-of-living crisis have intensified the problems for those already facing most disadvantage.
""We now need to upscale our efforts to widen access in Higher Education, if Scot* is to prosper as a high-skill economy, and to do so as an inclusive society.""
Background
Recent UCAS data  has shown that the number of 18-year-olds securing university places from the most deprived areas has increased since 2019 by 31% to a record high – demonstrating the progress Scot* is making on widening access. Additionally, acceptances from all ages groups in the most deprived areas increased by 4% since the UCAS cycle of 2019, which is the last year exams took place before the pandemic.
Prof McKendrick formally takes up the role as Commissioner for Fair Access on January 10.
John McKendrick is Professor of Social Justice at Glasgow Caledonian University and Co-Director of the Scot*Poverty & Inequality Research Unit. He has dedicated a career to tackling inequality and poverty in Scot* and has managed projects for and worked closely with a number of organisations in civil society and the public sector, including The Poverty Alliance, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Child Poverty Action Group.
Prof McKendrick also has a particular interest in equity in secondary and tertiary education and has led the evaluation of Glasgow Caledonian University’s flagship widening participation scheme, the Caledonian Club.            ",04/01/2023,New Commissioner for Fair Access

First-time buyers and others on low to medium incomes are being encouraged to take advantage of the Open Market Shared Equity Scheme to help buy a home in 2023.

The scheme allows people to buy a home without having to fund its entire cost and is available across Scot* to these people who face particular barriers to the housing market:

people aged 60 and over
 first time buyers
 social renters (people who rent from the council or a housing association)
 disabled people
 members of the armed forces
 veterans who have left the armed forces within the past two years
 widows, widowers and other bereaved partners of service personnel for up to two years after their partner has lost their life while serving
Housing Secretary Shona Robison said:

“We recognise the challenges people are facing in this cost of living crisis and we want to help as many people as possible to buy an affordable home this new year.

“This scheme puts applicants on a more level playing field with other buyers when purchasing an affordable home. Buyers can purchase a share of a property while holding the full title, with the Scottish-Government funding the remaining share under a shared equity agreement.

“Scot* continues to be a great place to buy a first home and has led the way in the delivery of affordable housing across the UK. We have now delivered almost 113,000 affordable homes since 2007, over 79,000 of which were for social rent.

“If you’re from one of the priority groups and would like to own a home, I’d encourage you to consider the Open Market Shared Equity scheme.”

In August 2022 the eligibility of the scheme was widened to put applicants on a more level playing field with other buyers when purchasing an affordable home.

The threshold of the Open Market Shared Equity Scheme – which allows people to buy a home without having to fund its entire cost – has been raised by 9% across the country to reflect rising house prices.

Thresholds are set at the lowest 25% of house prices in urban areas and the lowest 50% of house prices in rural areas.

The people of Scot* must be given a choice about their future given the damage inflicted by Brexit, Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson has said.
Marking two years since the end of the transition period to leave the European Union after 47 years of membership, Mr Robertson highlighted the negative impacts Brexit continues to have on Scot*’s economy.
Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson said:
“The damages caused by Brexit just continue to mount. In the two years since the end of the transition period, we have seen no advantages to leaving the European Union. The cost of living crisis and recession are being felt more deeply in the UK than anywhere else, with recent research showing food bills in the UK are £210 higher in the last two years due to Brexit. Households on the lowest incomes are the hardest hit.
“The UK economy is fundamentally on the wrong path and there is no real alternative on offer within the current system. The Scottish-Government is committed to giving the people of Scot* a choice about the future they want – a greener, wealthier and fairer economy within the European Union, or a sluggish, stagnating economy outside of the European Union. We will continue to publish the Building a New Scot* series of prospectus papers to ensure people can make that informed choice.
“According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, UK GDP is expected to be 4% lower as a consequence of Brexit – this equates to around £100 billion in output and £40 billion in public revenues lost each and every year. Businesses are suffering from lower exports to the EU, labour shortages and recruitment challenges. These issues are also affecting our NHS, with new research by the Nuffield Trust showing that lower EU migration is exacerbating staff shortages.
“Scot* is and always has been a proud European nation and we’re determined to continue to be an active and constructive participant on EU matters, which will ease the process of Scot*’s future return to the EU. This is in stark contrast to the approach being taken by the UK Government, intent on undermining retained EU law which will be hugely damaging to people and businesses in Scot*.”

The introduction of Adult Disability Payment, further automation and the increase and extension of Scot*Child Payment has seen more people apply for and get financial support they are entitled to.
Thousands of people have also had their benefit awards transferred to Social Security Scot* from the Department of Work and Pensions.
In March, Adult Disability Payment, which replaces the UK Government’s Personal Independence Payment and is the most complex benefit to be introduced so far, was launched as a pilot project before being made available to eligible disabled adults aged 16 to state pension age in Scot* at the end of August.
In November, Scot*Child Payment increased to £25 and was extended to include eligible children up to age 16 and around 385,000 children are now expected to be eligible.
At the same time, Social Security Scot* introduced further automation. Families and carers who already get Scot*Child Payment will now automatically be paid Best Start Grant Early Learning and School Age payments when their child is eligible.
Automatic payments continued for around 90,000 carers eligible for the December payment of Carers Allowance Supplement, as well as around 23,000 disabled children and young people who received Child Winter Heating Assistance to help heat their homes.
Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
“There is no doubt that 2022 has been the biggest and most complex year yet for Social Security Scot*. Creating a new social security system at pace has not been a simple task, but the progress made since 2018 has been substantial.
“Introducing Adult Disability Payment to replace the DWP’s Personal Independence Payment was a significant milestone in the growth of the Scot*social security system and marked a step change, delivering an improved experience for disabled people that is compassionate and rooted in trust.
“With many people facing financial hardship during the ongoing cost of living crisis, extending the Scot*Child Payment to under 16 year olds means that now hundreds of thousands more children will get much needed extra financial support.
“Investing in social security is a priority for the Scottish-Government. Our commitment in the 2023-24 Budget to uprate benefits by 10.1% will mean more support going to people on low-incomes, disabled people, carers and young people right across Scot* at a time when many are facing tough financial challenges.
“Though there is still much work to do, we are creating a system to be proud of  and building strong foundations to serve Scot* for generations to come, treating people with dignity, fairness and respect. Social security is a human right and an investment in creating a fairer society, together.”
Dad Martin, whose daughter has learning difficulties, says receiving benefits helped his daughter flourish.
He said: “I went on the website and applied for Child Disability Payment. When I got accepted I went from having nothing at the end of the month to having £97 left. This enabled me to do so many things with my daughter and because of that she has flourished.”
Another young woman who received the Young Carer’s Grant this year, said: “It had a positive impact because I needed new clothes so I spent about £100 on clothes and then I shared the rest of the grant with my brother and sister.”
A mum who received School Age Payment for their child said: “I applied for this grant for my child when she started primary one. It was a great help to us to cover the costs of school uniforms and accessories required for school. I would urge all parents to apply for this grant.”

                        Minister says Shared Prosperity Fund ‘fails communities’.
                    

Scot* is missing out on more than £300 million in European support under the UK Government’s replacement funding programme.
As the first payments are made to local authorities through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, Employment Minister Richard Lochhead said Scot* is suffering from a 60% shortfall in financial help.
The UK Government promised its UK Shared Prosperity Fund would replace in full all EU funding lost to Scot* after Brexit. But it has only allocated £212 million to Scot* over a three-year period, when EU funding would have been worth around £549 million over three years – a shortfall of £337 million.
The new fund is distributed exclusively through local authorities, excluding national, community and Third Sector groups, risking the loss of the services which these organisations provided. The UK Government has also taken sole responsibility for use of the funds; previously the Scottish-Government allocated EU funding to ensure the needs of Scot*’s people and communities were properly met.
Mr Lochhead said:
“EU structural funds have made a real difference across the country, helping more people into work and delivering new skills through better training and support. This welcome contribution from the EU has been eradicated by Brexit and the UK Government’s replacement for EU funding has fallen far short in both the quality and quantity of what is required.
“The UK Government has ignored the devolution settlement and failed to recognise the authority of the Scottish-Government in devolved areas. This replacement for EU funding ought to be fully devolved, allowing funding to flow to regions and communities in line with shared Scot*policies, designed to best serve Scot*needs.
“Shared Prosperity has also left local authorities racing against the clock to spend their funding by March, or face losing it and see their plans reduced to tatters due to the UK Government’s delay in only now agreeing the allocations.
“The approach taken thus far by the UK Government is against the principles of partnership working and risks diluting Scottish-Government efforts to transform the economy and support families and sustainable public services during this cost of living crisis.”
Background
The UK Shared Prosperity Fund sees Scot* allocated £32 million in 2022-2023, £55 million in 2023-24 and £125 million in 2024-25. Even the third year of funding delivers less than Scot* received before the UK’s EU Exit.
The Scottish-Government has calculated £162 million per year would be needed to replace the European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund, increasing to £183 million per year when LEADER funding and the EU Territorial Cooperation Programmes are added in.
Shared Prosperity funding is allocated over three years but delivered as single year payments and any underspend must be returned by local authorities to the UK Government at the end of each year.
EU funding has supported infrastructure projects and community initiatives across the country since the 1970s, with Scot* receiving and delivering more than £6 billion. Transformational projects, such as the University of the Highlands and Islands and the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney, have brought significant benefits to businesses and communities.
Projects previously supported by European Territorial Cooperation grants have included a scheme using video technology to help dementia patients stay at home rather than go into residential care, and a scheme developing tools powered by zero emissions hydrogen.

Scot*households have saved more than £3 billion in council tax since the Council Tax Reduction (CTR) scheme was introduced almost ten years ago.
The latest figures published by the Scottish-Government show 456,790 recipients received CTR in October 2022, meaning around one-in-five households were benefiting from the scheme.
People on low incomes are eligible for CTR if they live in Scot* – there is no equivalent benefit in England where most councils require each household to contribute a minimum amount of council tax, irrespective of ability to do so.
People who receive CTR save on average £750 a year and become eligible for up to 35% off their water and waste charges.
Public Finance Minister Tom Arthur said:
“The Council Tax Reduction scheme celebrates its tenth anniversary in April 2023 and these latest figures show the scale of support it has provided to people in Scot* over the last decade.
“The cost of living crisis is disproportionately affecting poorer households and now, more than ever, it is important everyone is aware of the help that is available.
“Some people are also eligible for other council tax discounts or sometimes full exemptions, including students, people with disabilities and carers amongst others.
“I urge people to check their eligibility for council tax reduction and other financial support by visiting our online resources or by contacting their local council.”
Background:
People can check whether they are eligible for Council Tax Reduction through mygov.scot or by contacting their local council.

“The rising cost of living is on everyone’s mind and many people are having to make difficult decisions about how they will pay for things. All this can have an impact on our mental health and wellbeing and lead to increased stress and anxiety.
“With the challenging times we’ve been through over the last few years, many are finding things particularly tough this year and it's normal to feel stressed or down.
“Reaching out to others for help, whether that’s to friends and family or to services who can provide emotional support, is often the hardest step. There is help and support available throughout – please don’t wait until after the festive season to speak to somebody.”

                        Landlords announce plans for average increases.
                    

Ministers have reached an agreement with social landlords on below-inflation rent increases for the next financial year.
Organisations representing social landlords have announced their members’ plans for average rent increases for 2023-24, which will keep rents significantly below private market levels.
Under the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Act 2022, rents are effectively frozen in the social rented sectors until 31 March 2023. Decisions on future plans for the private sector rent freeze, as well as other measures contained in the Act, will be announced in the coming weeks.
Tenants’ Rights Minister Patrick Harvie said:
“Our emergency legislation has given people – whether they rent in the private or social rented sector – reassurance within their current tenancies through the worst of the winter, even as their other costs have been rising.
“We recognise the enormous pressures households are facing, and by making this announcement now we aim to give social tenants advance notice, and confidence that any rent increase will be well below inflation.
“The statements of intent from the social rented sector, based on consultations with tenants, will keep rents affordable while allowing social landlords to continue investing in essential services such as home improvements and maintenance.""
Councillor Maureen Chalmers, COSLA’s Community Wellbeing Spokesperson, said:
“This is good news for Local Authority tenants from Scot*’s Council Leaders today. 
""In balancing the wide range of competing factors, Leaders with housing stock will seek to reach agreement with tenants over any increase in rents for the year 2023-24. Councils’ consultative arrangements would normally allow them, subject to approval of local governance structures, to raise rents annually to meet rising costs.
""During these difficult times, as providers of social housing and Gypsy/Traveller pitch or site provision, we intend to keep the rental and fee increases to an average of less than £5 a week across the country.”
Sally Thomas, Chief Executive at the Scot*Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA), said:
“We welcome the fact that Scottish-Government has worked closely with the sector, to understand the evidence and avoid unintended consequences of this legislation, and to find a collaborative way forward. Investing in good quality, warm homes for social rent is crucial to tackling poverty in Scot* and protecting new and existing tenants from the increasing cost of living.”
Background
COSLA and the Scot*Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA) have published statements setting out their members’ intentions for rent in 2023/24. COSLA has committed to keeping local authority rent increases to an average of no more than £5 a week. Members of the Scot*Federation of Housing Associations and Glasgow West of Scot* Forum of Housing Associations have reported planned increases averaging 6.1%.
The reference to average figures, rather than a fixed cap, allows for the flexibility to honour the outcomes of the statutory tenant consultations that social landlords must undertake each year on rent setting.
No social landlord is consulting on a rent increase at or above CPI inflation, which was 11.1% at the time of the data being collected.            ",21/12/2022,Agreement on social rents for 2023-24

                        New strategy to improve the lives of unpaid carers.
                    

A new National Carers Strategy will drive forward long-term changes to improve the lives of unpaid carers across Scot*.
It follows extensive engagement with carer organisations, carer centres, local government, and unpaid carers themselves. The strategy recognises the challenges of the cost crisis and COVID-19 recovery and supports long-term change that will allow carers to care for their loved ones in a way that balances all other aspects of their full and busy lives.
Recognising that unpaid carers come from all walks of life, the strategy also aims to ensure that their importance to society is recognised and that carers voices are represented and heard in national policy making.
Some of the actions in the strategy include:   
working with employers to support flexible and inclusive workplaces for those with caring responsibilities
supporting unpaid carers to direct them to appropriate resources during the cost crisis
investing in local carer support and short breaks for carers and delivering a new right to breaks from caring
Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart said:
“We want Scot* to be a place where all carers are valued for the contribution they make and can provide the right support for the people they care for while living full lives. No-one should need to put their life on hold because they provide care to a loved one.
“The Strategy sets out how we will support unpaid carers to care for loved ones without the financial worries and social isolation. 1 in 8 of us cares for someone, and we should be able to do that without having to fight for support, recognition, and quality of life.
“It provides a coherent picture of what the Scottish-Government is doing to build a sustainable future for unpaid carers. This includes the development of longer-term options for improvement to Scot*Carer’s Assistance and on-going work to consider a Minimum Income Guarantee.”
Martyn Sloan, unpaid carer representative, Dundee IJB said:
“I welcome this latest strategy from the Scottish-Government, their willingness to continue to engage with carers on all matters that are affecting them and the ongoing funding through the Carers Act shows that the government of Scot* values unpaid carers. The strategy document puts that commitment down in black and white.”
Don Williamson, Chief Executive, Shared Care Scot* on behalf of Scot*’s national carer organisations said:
“The strategy helpfully sets out government action across a range of policy areas that will, we hope, ensure its resources for carers are directed to where they will be most effective. We must now work together to ensure it delivers for carers and protects their health and wellbeing as we face up to the challenges ahead.”

                        Budget sets out £4.85 billion investment in Education and Skills.
                    

A range of measures to help children, parents and carers with costs around school have been set out in the Scottish-Government's budget. These include expansion of free school meals in primary schools, holiday food provision and investment to ensure the school clothing grant national minimum of £120 for primary pupils and £150 for secondary pupils.
The spending plans for 2023-24 allocates £4.85 billion of funding across the education and skills portfolio, including measures to address the cost of living crisis.
New investment will see free school meals expanded to primary six and seven pupils in receipt of the Scot*Child Payment – the next step in Scottish-Government plans to deliver universal free school meals in primary schools.
It also includes £22 million of continued support to provide meals during the school holidays to children who need them most, along with £200 million for the Scot*Attainment Challenge.
In addition, the budget allocates £50 million of funding to continue to support the Whole Family Wellbeing programme of activity, a key pillar of The Promise, to support families to thrive.
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:
""I am committed to improving the life chances of all Scot*’s children, young people and learners. The measures set out in these spending plans are driven by our ambition to enable everybody to reach their full potential.
""We know the toll that the cost of living crisis has taken on families and households across Scot* and investment is being made in a range of important measures which will help mitigate the impact of this.
""The expansion of free school meals in primary schools continues, providing a benefit in kind of around £400 per child for families, while the ongoing investment in the school clothing grant and access to digital devices will help those who need it most.
""Our ongoing commitment to free university tuition means that, unlike elsewhere in the UK, Scot*domiciled students do not incur additional debt of up to £27,750, and average student loan debt in Scot* remains the lowest in the UK.
“In Scot* we also have the most teachers-per-pupil, along with the highest per-pupil education spend anywhere in the UK. We will continue to provide local authorities with funding of £145.5 million per year to support the teaching workforce, as part of the overall local government settlement of £13.2 billion.
""Our commitment to closing the poverty related-attainment gap remains paramount and that is why we will invest a further £200 million next year in the Scot*Attainment Challenge – as part of our £1 billion commitment in this Parliament.”
The measures set out in the budget to help reduce the cost of school include:
Providing more than £13 million to uprate the School Clothing Grant in line with inflation.
Investing an additional £16 million resource and £80 million capital to fund the expansion of Free School Meals for all Primary 6 and 7 pupils in receipt of the Scot*Child Payment, as the next step in fulfilling the commitment to universal provision in primary schools
Continuing to invest £22 million to provide meals during school holidays to the children who need them most.
Maintaining subsidy arrangements for the provision of milk and working with partners on a phased approach to the delivery of a universal milk scheme, aligned to the expansion of free school meals.
Investing £20 million towards the commitment to ensure every school-aged child, over the lifetime of the parliament, has access to a digital device to support their learning
Investment of nearly £2 billion towards Scot*’s universities and colleges to support delivery of high-quality education and training. This includes a cash increase of £20 million in the Higher Education resource budget compared to 2022-23, and a cash increase of £33.7 million in the Further Education resource and capital budget.

A total of £964 million has been allocated to the Rural Affairs and Islands portfolio in the Scot*budget.
More than £620 million will provide ongoing agricultural support ensuring stability to farmers, crofters and land managers in 2023-24.
It comes as the first tranche of the Less Favoured Area Support Scheme payments are set to arrive in bank accounts ahead of schedule before Christmas.
The National Test Programme, which is helping farmers and crofters achieve statutory emissions targets, will see year two funded with £20 million.
Less Favoured Area Support Scheme payments are being made a month ahead of previous years and total £55.8 million.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: “Our farmers and crofters are vital to Scot*’s economy and the Scot*Budget 2023-24 reflects that.
“Despite the difficult financial circumstances we, like governments all over the world, are faced with, the Scottish-Government has sought to protect financial support for our farmers - to provide cash flow certainty amid these extremely challenging times.
“In addition, £405.5  million of Basic Payment Scheme and Greening payments have already been made to 17,001 farmers and crofters.”
“Within the latest budget, those working the land in the most remote and fragile areas will continue to receive support through the Less Favoured Areas Scheme, which has been allocated £65 million.”
“Our ambition to make Scot* a global leader in sustainable and regenerative agriculture is underlined by £44 million of funding.”

                        £20 million referendum funding will support people struggling with their energy bills.
                    

Thousands of vulnerable households will be supported by the continuation of the Scottish-Government’s uprated £20 million Fuel Insecurity Fund.
Announced as part of last week’s Scot*Budget 2023-24, the investment will enable third sector partners to continue to provide support to households who are at risk of self-disconnection or self-rationing their energy use. While the Scottish-Government remains committed to engaging with the UK Government to deliver a referendum on Scot*Independence, funding that was originally earmarked for a referendum in 2023 will now be used to help tackle fuel poverty.
Last week’s Scot*Budget included additional steps to address inequality while tackling the climate emergency including increased investment of over £366 million next year to support the delivery of the Heat in Buildings Strategy. It forms part of a package of measures introduced by the Scottish-Government to protect the most vulnerable households from the impact of the current cost of living crisis.
The decisions taken through the Emergency Budget Review in November enabled the Scottish-Government to provide additional immediate support to people most impacted by the cost of living crisis, specifically rising energy prices, by doubling the Fuel Insecurity Fund to £20 million this year. The Scot*Budget is now protecting that investment into 2023-24.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Minister for Zero Carbon Buildings Patrick Harvie met with people on the frontline of tackling fuel poverty, while visiting the Wise Group in Glasgow, a social enterprise working to lift people out of poverty by providing mentoring support to help with employment and life skills and offering energy advice.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
“People across our country are paying a steep price for the economic mismanagement of the UK Government, with the cost of living forcing many to choose between heating their home or eating – the Fuel Insecurity Fund aims to stop that happening.
“The Scottish-Government has, and always will, use its currently limited powers to the maximum extent in order to meet the challenges being faced by the people of Scot* right now. Powers relating to energy markets are reserved to the UK Government, so I am renewing my call for further and more urgent action, to support the most vulnerable households.
“With this intervention – as with many others the Scottish-Government has set out – we are having to divert funding into policies that aim to minimise the impact on people as a direct result of UK Government policy.
“The full powers of independence would enable us to make different choices and help people facing the devastating consequences of the cost of living crisis.”
Minister for Zero Carbon Buildings and Tenants' Rights Patrick Harvie said:
“Everyone needs a safe, warm and affordable place to call home and yet despite this we know that many people are struggling under the weight of their energy bills and wider cost of living pressures. Last week, the Scot*Budget confirmed £366m for insulating homes and buildings and tackling fuel poverty as part of our £1.8 billion commitment to Heat in Buildings over this Parliament.
“That is essential work to make sure that Scot* has warmer homes which are cheaper to heat for decades ahead.  We also need the full range of powers on matters like energy pricing, consumer protection and energy supply to make the biggest possible difference. But right now, the Fuel Insecurity Fund is a lifeline to many people struggling most with fuel poverty which is why we have made the commitment for next year.”
Background
The Scottish-Government’s Fuel Insecurity Fund includes provision for households on any tariff type and using any type of fuel.
The Wise Group play a significant role in enabling the success of energy crisis funding across the UK to support the tackling of fuel poverty. By March 2023, the Wise Group will have successfully distributed over £3 million of energy crisis funding directly to households and vulnerable energy customers since March 2020.
It is vital that those worried about, or struggling with, heating their homes access the information and support they need to reduce their energy bills. We have recently provided £1.2 million of extra funding to key agencies, including Advice Direct Scot*, Home Energy Scot* and Citizens Advice Scot*, to help those struggling to pay their bills and heat their homes. Those struggling with their energy bills should also speak to their provider to discuss options that might help mitigate or manage rising bills.

Almost £3.4 billion will be invested across the justice system in 2023-24 to fund vital front-line services, provide continued support for victims and witnesses, and to tackle the causes of offending.
Underlining the Scot*Budget’s priority to support sustainable public services despite the cost-of-living crisis, the funding represents an increase of £165 million or a 5.8% increase on this year’s justice resource budget.
Recognising the crucial role Police Scot* officers and staff play keeping our communities safe, the service will receive substantial additional resource funding of £80 million in the next financial year, a 6.3% increase. Police capital funding has been maintained at £45.5 million for investment in assets including the estate, fleet and technology. This brings the policing budget to £1.45 billion for 2023-24.
Equal access to justice for all is a key priority for the Scottish-Government, with an additional £3 million allocated in the budget to safeguard Legal Aid, and £3 million to strengthen access to Justice, to benefit deprived communities and vulnerable groups.
Funding of more than £42 million will be maintained to continue to reduce the backlog of court cases built up during the COVID-19 period and for community justice services, including alternatives to remand. The Scot*Fire and Rescue Service will receive a £10 million increase to support service delivery and the Scot*Prison Service gets an additional £29 million to support a modern and safe prison system.
Justice Secretary Keith Brown said:
“This Budget will support vital front-line services, provide support for victims and witnesses, and allow us to tackle the underlying drivers of offending.
“Our investment in policing has helped deliver historically low recorded crime rates, we have more police officers per head of population than England and Wales and new officers here start on significantly higher salaries that those in the rest of the UK.
 “The further increase of £80 million to police budgets next year builds on this solid track record to keep our communities safe.
“In this difficult financial landscape it is prudent we bring absolute focus to our key priorities which is why this Budget also continues essential funding to provide emotional and practical support for victims, while safeguarding Legal Aid and equal access to justice both now and into the future.
“Across the whole justice sector, this Budget will support delivery of our transformative reforms in a low crime environment where people feel safe.”
Background
The Justice Budget is part of a wider package of financial support presented to the Scot*Parliament on Thursday, 15 December by Deputy First Minister John Swinney.
The extra investment in Justice also includes:
An additional £80 million resource for the Scot*Police Authority, which provides safety and security for communities across Scot*.
Police core capital funding has been maintained at £45.5 million for investment in the police asset base including its greening the fleet programme.
Additional revenue spending of £29 million in the Scot*prison Service and continuing investment in the modernisation of the prison estate, with £97 million in capital funding provided.
Total investment of £134 million in community justice services, which includes the continuation of an additional investment of £15 million from 2022-23 to support recovery efforts, bolster capacity, and strengthen alternatives to remand by improving and increasing the use of bail services. 
The Scottish-Government will provide an additional £5 million resource and £4.7 million capital for the Scot*Courts and Tribunals Service. This will help to meet pay and inflation pressures, and to support essential capital repair and replacement works.
£4.2 million is being invested in Legal Aid, alongside £3 million to strengthen access to justice, including in deprived communities and for vulnerable groups.
£3.5 million is being invested this year in the continued delivery of the Digital Evidence Sharing Capability programme which will allow evidence to be shared digitally from crime scene to court room, significantly improving efficiency in the investigation and prosecution of crime.
Continuation of the £48 million over 3-year funding support for victims’ organisations across Scot*, through the Victim Centred Approach Fund.

Health and Social Care services will receive the highest ever budget settlement over the next year, paving the way for sustainable public services in Scot*.
The £19 billion package will help tackle the immediate pressures caused by the pandemic and a tough winter, while supporting the delivery of health and care services that are fit for the future.
The Scottish-Government has surpassed its commitment to ensure every extra penny it receives from the UK Government is spent on health and social care. This means an extra £1 billion will be available to improve front line services and help fund the NHS pay deal for 2022/23.
Health Boards across Scot* will receive a 6% boost in funding as part of the Budget – bringing their total budget to £13.7 billion, which includes over £9 billion to give staff a fair wage.
Social care and integration will also benefit from £1.7 billion in funding over the next year. This will help deliver vital reforms of social care, continue work towards creating the country’s first National Care Service, and improving conditions for care workers – by funding a £10.90 Real Living Wage for adult social care workers in commissioned services.
This Budget continues to support prevention and early intervention, as well as the provision of quality community care, providing:
More than £1.2 billion for mental health services to provide record staff numbers that provide more varied support and services to more people than ever.
Over £2 billion to deliver and improve primary health care services in the community, enabling dental reform and supporting crucial GP services through investment in multi-disciplinary teams and targeted assistance to support system
£160 million to address the public health emergencies and reduce the avoidable harms associated with drugs and alcohol.
Fully restoring the budget for life-saving procedures such as thrombectomies – which remove blood clots – despite the need to make a short term reduction to tackle the inflationary pressures faced by the whole UK.
Health Secretary, Humza Yousaf, said:
“Frontline workers are the foundation of our health and care services and I am extremely grateful for them for getting us through the pandemic and facing-down one of the toughest winters in NHS history.
“This historic settlement took some difficult decisions, but we are steadfast in efforts to address the immediate pressures on health and social care services, and support fair work and pay.
“I want health and care services that are fit for the future – a future where Scot* continues to be the best place for health and care workers and where everyone gets the care that they need, where and when they need it.”
John Watson, Associate Director of the Stroke Association in Scot* said:
“The stroke community in Scot* was united in alarm over recent cuts to the thrombectomy programme and we therefore welcome this renewed funding of a life-saving, and cost-saving service. The Cabinet Secretary has now given us his assurance that the commitment to a national round-the-clock thrombectomy service remains.
“We look forward to continuing this positive discussion, with the aim of a clear timetable for delivering one of the most effective and cost-saving procedures available to us.”
Chest Heart and Stroke Scot* Chief Executive Jane-Claire Judson said:
“We welcome that the Scottish-Government has listened to stroke survivors, charities and health professionals and restored funding for developing a national thrombectomy service. This cost-effective and life-changing procedure can make a huge difference to stroke survivors ensuring many more are able to walk again, talk again and live their lives to the full.
“We now need to see work on setting up a 24/7 national service restart as a matter of urgency and a timetable for delivery so that every stroke patient who needs it gets the best chance of living life to the full.”              ",16/12/2022,Record £19 billion for Health and Social Care

                        Strengthening the social contract with Scot*’s people.
                    

 
Deputy First Minister John Swinney laid out “a different, more progressive path for Scot*” as he presented the Scot*Budget 2023-24.
He promised to strengthen the social contract with the people of Scot* and pledged to do everything possible to shield families from the welfare cuts and austerity policies of the UK Government.
Supporting sustainable public services through the cost of living crisis is a priority – including more than £13.7 billion for NHS boards and £2 billion to establish and improve primary healthcare services in communities, as well as £1.7 billion for social care and integration, paving the way for the National Care Service. This record investment goes well beyond any previous commitment to pass on all consequentials to health and social care, and delivers a £1 billion uplift to the health budget.
Having already increased the unique Scot*Child Payment to £25 per week as part of a drive to eradicate child poverty, the Budget invests £428 million to uprate all other devolved benefits in April 2023 by September’s Consumer Price Index inflation level of 10.1%. It commits £20 million to extend the Fuel Insecurity Fund to provide a lifeline for households, including the most vulnerable, against rising energy prices.
Scot*’s transition to net zero is boosted with increased investment to over £366 million in delivering the Heat in Buildings Strategy in 2023-24. This will help tackle fuel poverty as part of a £1.8 billion commitment over this Parliament to improve energy efficiency and decarbonise more than a million Scot*homes by 2030.
The Budget commits £50 million to the Just Transition Fund for the North East and Moray - more than double the 2022-23 allocation - to diversify the regional economy away from carbon-intensive industries and capitalise on the opportunities presented by new, green industries.
Strengthened by the agreement between the Scottish-Government and the Scot*Green Party, the 2023-24 Scot*Budget also includes:
around £1 billion investment in high quality early learning and childcare provision, with a further £22 million invested in holiday food provision and expanding support for school-age childcare
£50 million for the Whole Family Wellbeing programme for preventative co-ordinated family support and a further £30 million to keep The Promise to care experienced children and young people
£80 million capital funding to support the expansion of free school meals
going beyond existing commitments with more than £550 million additional funding to Local Government
£165 million additional funding for frontline justice services and to continue with transformational reforms
a £46 million increase in resource funding to universities and colleges to ensure a highly qualified and highly skilled workforce for Scot*
Mr Swinney said:
“The Scottish-Government, like governments all over the world, is faced with a difficult set of choices. Through this Budget we are facing up to our responsibilities while being honest with the people of Scot* about the challenges which lie ahead.
“To govern is to choose and the Scottish-Government has made its choice.
“Within the powers available to us, we will choose a different path. A path which sees the Scottish-Government commit substantial resources to protect the most vulnerable people of Scot* from the impact of decisions and policies made by the UK Government. We choose to stand firmly behind the Scot*people, investing in our public services and doing everything possible to ensure that no one is left behind.
“This Budget strengthens the social contract between the Scottish-Government and every citizen of Scot* for the wider benefit of society. This social contract means that people in Scot* continue to enjoy many benefits not available throughout the UK – including free prescriptions, free access to higher education and the Scot*Child Payment. 
“Because we know this progressive model works, we choose the path where people are asked to pay their fair share, in the knowledge that in so doing they help to create the fairer society in which we all want to live.”

The 2023-24 Scot*Budget will take a distinctive approach to creating a fairer, more equal Scot*, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said.
He stressed the three Budget priorities of eradicating child poverty, strengthening public services and moving towards a net zero economy were strongly linked and would give more people the opportunity to flourish.
Ahead of delivering the Budget to Parliament today, Mr Swinney visited a scheme, delivered by City of Edinburgh Council and part-funded by the Scottish-Government, installing insulation for households at risk of fuel poverty.
He said:
“I was encouraged to see the vital work being carried out to improve energy efficiency and make homes warmer for families facing significantly higher bills this winter. This scheme highlights how tackling the increased cost of living can assist our drive towards net zero, and is an example of the importance of effective public services.
“Our Budget goals are mutually beneficial and represent a distinctive approach to the economic challenges we face. The Scot*Budget will take further steps to address inequality and eradicate child poverty. It will encourage a just transition to net zero, creating wealth and opportunity across the country. And it will be the catalyst for reforms necessary to ensure our first-class public services remain sustainable in the face of the challenges to come.
“I would like to go even further but the cost of living crisis has also laid bare the fiscal constraints of devolution, as we cannot borrow to support day to day expenditure when times are hard to assist us through these difficult days. It is clear that businesses and households are paying a steep price for the economic mismanagement of the UK Government.
“The cost of living crisis requires decisive action. In setting this Budget, the Scottish-Government will use its limited powers to the maximum extent that is responsible, to meet the challenges faced by the people of Scot*.”
Background
 The Scot*Budget 2023-24 will be presented to the Scot*Parliament on Thursday 15 December.
The Scottish-Government has provided more than £550 million since 2013 to councils across Scot* to provide insulation in hard-to-treat homes, helping 104,000 fuel poor households make their homes warmer and more energy efficient.

                        Primary school literacy and numeracy improvement reaches new high.
                    

The poverty-related attainment gaps in literacy and numeracy levels across primary schools have seen the biggest decreases since records began, official statistics show.
The gap between the proportion of primary pupils from the most and least-deprived areas achieving expected levels has narrowed by 3.4 percentage points in literacy and 3.7 percentage points in numeracy, according to the Achievement of Curriculum for Excellence Levels (ACEL) 2021/22. This marks the largest narrowing of the gap in a year since consistent records began in 2016/17.
There has also been a record increase in the proportion of primary school pupils achieving the expected levels of literacy (up 3.7 percentage points to 70.5%) and numeracy (up 3.3 percentage points to 77.9%).
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:
“These figures demonstrate a real recovery from the pandemic and underline our progress towards tackling the poverty-related attainment gap, and achieving excellence for all of Scot*’s children and young people.
“This record improvement over one year for primary pupils achieving the expected levels in numeracy and literacy also shows more young people are getting the support they need to reach their full potential.
“However, there is no room for complacency. I recognise that attainment levels are still largely below pre-pandemic levels and the publication of local stretch aims by local councils last week sets out clear plans to significantly narrow the poverty-related attainment gap in the years ahead.
“We know that the impact of the pandemic – compounded by the current cost of living crisis – means children and young people need our support now more than ever. We are determined to do all we can to ensure they can reach their full potential, including a record investment of £1billion over this parliamentary term in the Scot*Attainment Challenge.”
Background
The Achievement of Curriculum for Excellence Levels (ACEL) 2021/22 statistics  include data at Scot* level and for each local authority.
Data was collected and published for primary school pupils only in 2020/21 with the secondary school and special school  collection cancelled due to the additional work pressures on teachers resulting from the Alternative Certification Model.
Therefore, for S3 pupils comparisons cannot be made to 2020/21 as the data was not collected for that year. Attainment at this level has been close to 90 per cent for both literacy and numeracy since 2016/17. In 2021/22, 86% of S3 pupils achieved this level in literacy, with 89 per cent in numeracy.
In 2021/22, the full collection went ahead for the first time since 2018/19 meaning that data is being published for P1, P4, P7, S3 and special schools.            ",13/12/2022,Record narrowing of the attainment gap

Eradicating child poverty, transforming the economy to deliver net zero and creating sustainable public services will be the key aims of the Scot*Budget 2023-24.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney warned relentless prioritisation was needed to tackle the combined impact of high inflation, the ongoing economic consequences of Brexit and the UK Government’s plans to reduce expenditure in future years, which are projected to reduce the Scottish-Government’s funding under the Barnett formula from 2025.
He said the Budget would channel support to where it was most needed while beginning a process of reform to help public services face the future with strength and resilience.
Mr Swinney said:
“Families, businesses and our public finances are under sustained economic pressure and the Scottish-Government has acted decisively to provide what support it can within its limited resources. We have allocated £3 billion in 2022-23 to mitigate the impact of the cost of living crisis, including targeted help such as increasing the game changing Scot*Child Payment to £25 per eligible child per week – a 150% increase within eight months. 
“However, given the fiscal constraints of devolution, it is not possible to go as far as we would like and so the Budget will prioritise three areas – eradicating child poverty, transforming the economy to deliver net zero and creating sustainable public services.
""Difficult decisions are required and resources will be targeted where they are most needed and can secure maximum value from every pound spent.
“The economic challenges we face also require a fundamental change in the way we manage public spending. The Bank of England is predicting the longest recession for a century so this Budget will set in motion reforms that will place our finances and public services on a more sustainable and resilient footing for the future.
“This is a time for firm leadership and bold decision making. Steps we take now will help ensure Scot* emerges from the current crisis a stronger, fairer, greener country.”

                        £1.4 million Cost Crisis Emergency Fund launched.
                    

Islanders most impacted by the cost of living crisis will be able to access additional help.
The Islands Cost Crisis Emergency Fund will target immediate support to those who are struggling due to the cost of living crisis, either through existing schemes or new support.
The Fund was identified as part of the Emergency Budget Review announced last month as the cost of living on islands is higher when compared to the mainland. Funding is being allocated directly to the six island local authorities to support the needs of their communities.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said:
“Islands already experience higher costs of living, with some estimates around 20-65 per cent higher than the UK average, with higher fuel costs, a colder climate and the lack of consumer choice intensifying the impact of the cost crisis on islanders.
“This fund was developed to enable Local Authorities to take urgent action in helping mitigate the impacts of the cost of living crisis on households.  
“I would like to thank everyone involved for their commitment in getting this fund rolled out as quickly as possible and I hope it can provide support to those who need it the most.”
Sheila McKandie Head of Revenues & Customer Services at the Highland Council said:
“Highland Council very much welcome the Island Cost Crisis Emergency Fund award.
“This will supplement existing funds and help in providing further support to our island communities.”
James Stockan Council Leader at Orkney Islands Council said:
“As we head into winter, households right across our community are facing rising bills, increasing costs, and tough choices. This financial support from the Scottish-Government is a welcome boost as we face these challenges. 
“Our share of the fund is £305,000, of which £65,000 must be capital spend – elected members and officials will now be taking the time to determine how best we spend all of this fund to provide the optimum benefit for our community.”

                        More help for victims as criminals pay towards costs.
                    

The third application round of the Victim Surcharge Fund has now opened for bids from organisations that support victims of crime.
Anyone who commits a crime that results in a court fine is charged an additional penalty – the victim surcharge. The accumulated Victim Surcharge Fund provides direct, practical help to victims, for example meeting household repair costs that have arisen due to crime, or providing food, utility or clothing expenses for people escaping domestic abuse.
A total of £413,727 has been awarded to organisations, including Victim Support Scot*, trauma and loss centre the Manda Centre and Scot*women’s aid groups, since the Scottish-Government launched the Victim Surcharge Fund in 2019.
Justice Secretary Keith Brown said:
“We are committed to putting victims' rights and needs at the centre of the criminal justice system and it is absolutely right that criminals should pay towards helping victims of crime as they recover from their experience.
“The Victim Surcharge Fund builds on the Scottish-Government’s wider support for victims. Over the past five years we have invested £93m through our justice budget alone, demonstrating our commitment to putting victims first.
“I encourage victim support organisations to apply to the Fund so that victims can continue to access the support and help that they need.”
Chief Executive of Victim Support Scot* Kate Wallace said:
“The cost-of-living crisis has meant that more people affected by crime are struggling to make ends meet. This additional funding from the Victim Surcharge Fund allows VSS to cover the cost of essential items such as food vouchers, property repairs, alarms and funeral costs, thereby meeting the needs of vulnerable victims in the aftermath of crime.
“Since 2020, VSS Emergency Assistance Fund has provided £495,000 worth of goods to more than 1,000 people and their families, thanks to funding from the Victim Surcharge Fund. We accept applications directly from people affected by crime and have received referrals from over 200 support organisations.
“For many of the people we support, this financial assistance is simply life changing. We welcome the news that the fund has reopened, which helps empower people to move on after a crime.”
Background 
Victims' organisations interested in applying to the Fund can request an application form by emailing VictimSurchargefund@gov.scot and should apply by the 9 January 2023 deadline.
Previous recipients have included Victim Support Scot*, The Moira Fund, The Manda Centre, Angus Women’s Aid and Dumbarton District Women’s Aid.
The victim surcharge came into force in Scot* on 25 November 2019 and applies to all persons who commit an offence on or after that date and who are subsequently convicted and receive a court fine.

Scot*’s attractiveness to global investors will be enhanced by the establishment of the First Minister’s Investor Panel.
The expert panel of investors and asset managers will advise on how Scot* can create the right conditions to attract global capital investment to develop the physical infrastructure required for a just transition. Its remit includes areas such as offshore wind, hydrogen and the decarbonisation of transport.
Members have been selected for their experience and expertise, bringing together a wealth of knowledge to provide market intelligence in current and future green investment opportunities.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Angus MacPherson, CEO at Noble & Company, will co-chair the Panel, which will meet for the first time on 12 December. 
Speaking at TheCityUK Annual Conference in Edinburgh, the First Minister said:
“Securing capital investment from sources within Scot*, across the UK, and right around the world is fundamental to enabling us to achieve our wider ambitions for the economy. Tackling the climate crisis is both a moral obligation and an economic opportunity. We have the chance to establish Scot* as a major centre for green and ethical finance, while helping Scot* - and perhaps also the wider world - to move to net zero.
“The investor panel demonstrates the Scottish-Government’s determination to work with the investor community. We know how crucial it is to support sustainable growth and we want to use insights and expertise from the sector as we recover from the pandemic, get through the cost of living crisis, and ensure a just and rapid transition to net zero.""
Angus MacPherson, co-chair of the Panel, said:
“I am delighted to accept the First Minister’s invitation to Co-chair the Investor Panel.
“There is a clear and compelling case for the private and public sectors to work together to address the global challenges we face, particularly on the need to transition to net zero.
“I look forward to working with the First Minister and panel members to explore how we can attract mobile capital investment, maximise current and future growth opportunities and help deliver a just transition to net zero.”
Miles Celic, Chief Executive Officer at TheCityUK, said:
“Scot*’s financial and related professional services industry has always had innovation at its core. It has long played an important role in driving growth and opportunity here at home and around the world. To build on this success and unlock the investment needed to fund critical projects for a Net-Zero future in Scot* and beyond, a close partnership between government, industry and regulators is essential.”
Background
The Scottish-Government committed in Scot*'s National Strategy for Economic Transformation - gov.scot (www.gov.scot) to establishing an Investor Panel to attract investment for a pipeline of projects in Scot* that support the transition to net zero and that brings investor intelligence to policy and regulatory development early in the process.

People who receive Scot*Child Payment and qualify for Best Start Grant Early Learning and School Age payments will be paid them automatically from this week, without the need to apply for them separately. 
Social Security Scot* will notify clients by SMS when they are checking eligibility for the Best Start Grants and, if they are eligible, will write to advise them of the payment.
The move to automatic awards will mean less paperwork for tens of thousands of families and ensure that families automatically receive the support to which they’re entitled.
It builds on work already completed to make applying for our five family payments as simple as possible.
It includes the ability to apply for all children in a household on a single form.
Minister for Social Security, Ben Macpherson said:
""Our extension to the Scot*Child Payment and its increase to £25 per child per week has been widely welcomed and will make a significant difference to families across the country. The increase represents a rise of 150% in just eight months.
“The increase and extension was described as a watershed moment in tackling child poverty by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and already people have applied in their tens of thousands.
“Tackling child poverty is a key mission for the Scottish-Government and automating payments, where we have the information we need to do so, will mean parents and carers automatically getting the financial support they are eligible for paid directly to them.
“We are committed to making sure that receiving our five family payments is as straightforward as possible, using our limited social security powers and resources to help”.
CEO of One Parent Families Scot*, Satwat Rehman said
“We are delighted that Social Security Scot* have made changes so that parents who have applied for and receive Scot*Child Payment will no longer have to fill out separate forms to receive other family benefits.
“Many of the single parents we support are not aware of the financial support available to them and would therefore be at risk of losing out. We hope the change to automatic payments will lead to an increase in the number of families accessing benefits they are entitled to and will ease the financial and mental strain of the cost-of-living crisis.”
Background
Best Start Grant Early Learning Payment and Best Start Grant School Age Payment are part of a package of five family payments. This package also includes Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment, Best Start Foods and Scot*Child Payment. The Scottish-Government’s package of five family payments for low-income families is worth up to a maximum of over £10,000 by the time a family’s first child turns 6, and £9,700 for second and subsequent children
Best Start Grant Early Learning Payment provides £267.65 per child to support child development, for example travel costs, trips out and toys for home learning
The School Age Payment provides £267.65 per child to help with the costs of preparing for school, for example educational toys or after school activities. Eligibility is based on the child’s age and relates to when a child is first old enough to start school. The application window runs from 1 June until the last day in February the following year.

                        Reported figures just ‘tip of the iceberg’.
                    

Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Veterans Keith Brown is encouraging people experiencing domestic abuse to seek help, advice or support – and where appropriate, report incidents to the police.
Official statistics for 2021-22 released today, show a 1% fall in the number of domestic abuse incidents recorded by the police. Of these, just over four-in-five had a female victim and a male suspected perpetrator.
It is the first time since the ground-breaking Domestic Abuse (Scot*) Act, which criminalised psychological domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour and came into effect in 2019 - that the number of reported incidents has fallen.
However, the most recent results from the Scot*Crime and Justice Survey (for 2018-20) estimated that fewer than one-in-five cases of domestic abuse are reported to the police.
Since the launch of the 2018 Domestic Abuse (Scot*) Act, Scottish-Government has introduced a range of measures to create a victim-centred justice system which helps people feel more confident in reporting crimes. This includes:
Establishing a Domestic Homicide Review taskforce to help prevent homicides in Scot* where domestic abuse is suspected
Providing £26.5m of funding to courts in 2021-22 to maintain enhanced court capacity, helping to address backlogs
Introducing new Evidence by Commission suites – to improve the experience of vulnerable victims when providing evidence for court cases.
Awarding £48m of funding to 23 organisations in Scot* over the next three years, through its Victim-Centred Approach Fund, including £18.5m for specialist advocacy support for survivors of gender-based violence.
The 2022-23 Programme for Government also commits to a consultation on new justice powers to tackle misogynistic behaviour, helping to address the root causes of inequalities and men’s violence against women. The Scottish-Government is also considering the possibility of a specialist sexual offences court to help improve victims’ experience of the justice system.
Mr Brown said: “I am grateful to everyone who has felt able to come forward over the past year to report incidents of domestic abuse to the police. Behind each of these numbers is a story in itself, of months or even years of abuse and control, which is why the Scottish-Government legislated to give police, prosecutors and the courts greater powers to tackle such crimes.
“While the small drop in the number of domestic abuse incidents reported to the police may be welcome, the reality has always been that figures drawn from police reports represent only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the true extent of violence against women and girls.
“My message to anyone experiencing violence, including coercive and controlling behaviours, is to seek help, advice or support – and where appropriate, report incidents to the police.
“We are continuing to make changes to the justice system to make it easier for people to come forward and report incidents and for perpetrators to be appropriately dealt with – to help realise our vision of a Scot* as a place where women and girls live free of violence and abuse.”
Assistant Chief Constable Bex Smith, Police Scot* said: “Domestic abuse remains an under-reported crime. Abusers manipulate and control their victims, and it can be difficult for victims to recognise what’s happening and then to seek help.
“Friends, families and colleagues can often be the first to recognise abuse and to call it out. I would urge anyone who is a victim of abuse or is concerned someone they know is a victim, then please get in touch. Help and support is available from the police and from support agencies.
“All it takes is one call or one person to alert us and we can help end the threat and harm caused by domestic abuse.”
Victim Support Scot* chief executive, Kate Wallace, said:
“Victim Support Scot* (VSS) is here to support people when they need it most. Looking beyond the statistics, our teams witness the devastating impact gender-based violence has on peoples’ lives.
“We all have a collective duty to unite and respond to people’s needs and do what we can to tackle gender-based violence. In response, our staff and volunteers continue to provide practical advice, emotional support as well as financial support through our Emergency Assistance Fund.
“VSS has also recently introduced remote evidence rooms where victims can pre-record or give evidence via video link to anywhere in the world, in a safe, supported and comfortable environment. 
“Anyone who is experiencing domestic abuse can access support through our helpline on 0800 160 1985 or through online chat by going to victimsupport.scot.”
Scot*Women’s Aid chief executive Marsha Scott said:  
‘’There are many complex and legitimate reasons why women experiencing domestic abuse decide not to report their abuse to the police. At Scot*Women’s Aid, we offer practical and emotional support to all victim-survivors of domestic abuse - whatever they decide to do—after all, they are the experts.  Throughout the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, Scot*Women’s Aid’s ‘Cost of Leaving’ campaign will highlight the impact that the cost of living crisis is having on women and children experiencing domestic abuse.
“Like Covid, children and women’s experience of poverty is the crisis within a crisis.  Fear of destitution and homelessness, mountains of debt, and threats from their abusers to child maintenance and other pressures make already constrained choices a set of worse-case scenarios. 
“The domestic abuse statistics hardly begin to describe the abuse and fear that are made worse by the cost of living crisis. Scot* must put an appropriate financial safety net in place so that children and women seeking safety and freedom don’t face these draconian choices.”

                        An Official Statistics Publication for Scot*.
                    

Statistics on annual average private sector rents to the end of September 2022, based predominantly on advertised rent data, have been released today by Scot*’s Chief Statistician.
Average rents for two bedroom properties, the most common type of private rented home in Scot*, have increased in 17 out of 18 areas of Scot* compared with the previous year.
Increases in seven of these areas were above the annual rate of inflation of 7.6%, ranging from 7.7% in Greater Glasgow up to 10.3% in South Lanarkshire. Meanwhile the average two bedroom rent in the Ayrshires decreased by 1.5%.
These regional trends combine to show an estimated 6.2% annual increase in average two bedroom monthly rents at a Scot* level.
Average rents increased at a Scot* level across all property size categories, with increases of 6.3%, 6.2%, 7.4%, 7.5% and 6.9% for one to four bedroom and one bedroom shared properties respectively.
Over the longer term, average rents in Lothian and Greater Glasgow have increased above the rate of inflation of 33.7% between 2010 and 2022 across all property sizes, whilst the Ayrshires, Dumfries and Galloway, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire have seen increases in average rents of less than the rate of inflation across all property sizes.
Background
These statistics refer to the average 12 month UK Consumer Price Index rate of inflation, which was 7.6% across the year to end September 2022, and which has been 33.7% between the year to end September 2010 and the year to end September 2022.
The full statistical publication includes main findings on rent levels for one bedroom, two bedroom, three bedroom, four bedroom, and one bedroom shared properties. It presents information on rent levels for these property sizes across each of the 18 broad rental market areas in Scot* and contains information on average rents as well as rents at the higher and lower end of the market.
The publication uses data from the Rent Service Scot* market evidence database, which is collected for the purposes of determining annual Local Housing Allowance levels and Local Reference Rent. The rental information contained in the market evidence database is largely based on advertised rents, therefore it is important to note that the statistics presented in this publication do not represent rent changes for existing tenants.
In addition, note that these statistics cover the period to year end September 2022, and so largely pre-date the Programme for Government proposals for emergency cost of living rent freeze legislation announced on 6 September 2022.

                        Starting salary for a fully qualified teacher to reach £35,650.
                    

A new progressive pay offer – the fourth which has been made to unions - recognises the impact of the cost of living crisis on lower-paid teachers, with an increase of up to 6.85%.
For those classroom teachers on the main grade scale, who benefit from pay progression, this offer will mean an increase in one year of over 10%.
Those at the top of the scale will receive a 5% increase, taking their salary to £44,453. A teacher moving from probation into a fully qualified post would gain an annual salary increase of 27%.
A fully qualified teacher in Scot* would receive £35,650 – over £7,500 more than their counterparts in England under the offer. The most experienced classroom teachers would receive £5,600 more than they would if they were teaching in England on the main pay range.
Overall, if accepted, this would represent a cumulative pay increase for the majority of teachers of 21.8% since 2018.
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:
""This is a fair offer which recognises that the cost of living crisis is the priority, with higher increases for staff on lower salaries. 
""This is now the fourth offer that has been made. In the same time EIS have not changed their request for a 10% pay increase – even for those on the highest incomes.
""I have been clear that we have limited room for manoeuvre. The financial situation for the Scottish-Government is challenging and additional money for teacher pay means reduced public services elsewhere.
""In these challenging times it is important we focus our attention on those who are most impacted by the cost of living crisis, as well as ensuring fairness to all public sector workers. I would urge leadership to postpone plans for industrial action and consider this new offer.”
Background
The offer will mean a minimum increase of £1,926 or 5%, whichever is higher, for those earning up to £60,000. Everybody earning over £60,000 p.a. will still receive a pay increase of £3,000.

                        Roadmap to fair, green prosperity for communities and regions.
                    

Improvements to health, tackling child poverty and reaching climate goals are at the heart of a toolkit to support local economies to be fairer, greener, healthier and more resilient.
The Wellbeing Economy Toolkit: Supporting place-based economic strategy and policy development enables local authorities to identify and measure local wellbeing metrics including health, child poverty, levels of greenhouse gas emissions and fair work, and prioritise investments and policies to improve them.
This will include:
the creation of more high quality, sustainable local jobs by using more local and regional procurement contracts
improved transport links to help people access services and work
better access to the natural environment, which leads to better mental and physical health
The Constitution Secretary announced the toolkit at the Wealth of Nations 2.0 conference at the University of Glasgow. He was joined by representatives from fellow Wellbeing Economy Governments (WEGo) of Finland and Wales to take questions from young people, five years on from the first conversations to establish the network.
Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson said:
“The need for a new economic model has never been clearer, and that’s why I think the wellbeing economy approach is gaining so much interest, both here, and around the world.
“We see that in the growth of WEGo - the network of wellbeing economy governments – which began as a coalition of Scot*, Iceland and New Zealand. Since this event was last held in 2020, two more governments – Finland and Wales – have joined, and other countries including Canada are showing a growing interest.
“Creating a wellbeing economy remains a defining mission for the Scottish-Government, and it is my firm belief that Scot* could use the powers of independence to achieve that aim more fully. 
“Building a wellbeing economy is a huge challenge for any country, at any time. The current crises we are facing make it harder, but they also underline why we need to make this transformation as a matter of urgency.”
Jimmy Paul, Director of Wellbeing Economy Alliance Scot*, said: 
""This practical new toolkit will be an invaluable resource for developing local economic strategies that really work for communities.
“Amidst the cost of living and climate crises, it’s never been more important that economic approaches start with the goal of ensuring we all have what we need to live good lives and protect the health of our natural world, rather than continuing to centre outdated metrics like GDP growth. The toolkit could provide a step-change in the way local economic strategies are delivered in Scot*.”

                        No measures to ease pressure on devolved budgets.
                    

 
The UK Government’s Autumn Statement fails to address the pressure on devolved budgets to help people with the cost of living crisis, support public services, and finance fair pay offers, according to Deputy First Minister John Swinney.
Reacting to Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt’s fiscal announcement, Mr Swinney expressed dismay at his failure to address the impact of inflation on the Scottish-Government’s budget, when businesses and households continue to face financial uncertainty and £1 billion in savings have had to be found to help those who need it most.
The Deputy First Minister said:
“Today’s statement shows that households across Scot* are paying a steep price for the economic mismanagement of the UK Government, with average household disposable incomes forecast to fall by 7% in real terms according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. This would erode just under 10 years of growth in living standards, taking them back to levels not seen since 2013-14, meaning they would not recover to pre-pandemic levels until after 2027-28 – a devastating indictment of the UK Government’s management of the economy.
“Inflation is eating away at the Scot*budget, and due to the lack of additional funding in 2022-23 and the financial restrictions of devolution, we have had no choice but to make savings of more than £1 billion.
“I welcome the Chancellor’s decision to increase benefits in line with inflation from next financial year and retain the triple lock on pensions - both measures we have consistently called for. However, the higher energy price cap from April is still unsustainable for many households. The proposals may limit the impact for some consumers, but the UK Government needs to carefully consider the affect a £500 rise in energy bills will have on those who are in or at risk of fuel poverty. And there’s still no certainty on how businesses struggling to stay afloat will be supported from April after the Energy Bill Relief Scheme ends.
“The constant U-turns on tax by the UK Government have made planning for the Scot*Budget more challenging this year. We will take time to consider the implications for Scot* before setting out our own plans as part of the normal budget process. I am pleased the Chancellor has finally listened to our calls to tax more of the windfall gains in the energy sector, but he should have gone further to remove the poorly targeted investment allowance, which only serves to encourage short-term investment in fossil fuels rather than promoting long-term, sustainable energy solutions.
“This leaves me with the difficult task of setting Scot*’s Budget for 2023-24 with no hope of financial flexibility to make a real difference in the lives of those who need it most.”            ",17/11/2022,Households ‘paying a steep price for UK economic mismanagement'

                        New round of monitor farms to optimise production in the farming sector.
                    

The latest cycle of a programme promoting sustainable innovation and transformational change in the agricultural sector has taken a step forward.
Backed by £1.7 million of funding, nine farms across Scot* will take part in the Scot*Monitor Farm Programme (MFP).
The programme focusses on practical farming and good business practices to build resilient, dynamic farms focused on reaching full economic, social and environmental sustainability.
The project brings research and industry closer together to optimise production and sharing best-practice learning and experience across the agricultural sector.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: “I am delighted to see the range of farms taking part in the Monitor Farm Project.
“This long-running programme is ideally placed to support the wider agricultural sector to optimise production, contributing to our food security while helping meet our climate change and net zero targets.
“Innovation and sustainability has never been more important for an industry facing the significant challenges of the on-going war in Ukraine and against the backdrop of Covid-19, Brexit and the cost of living crisis.
“I would encourage farmers and crofters to engage with the programme and benefit from the shared knowledge and experiences that come from the Monitor Farm Project.”
Monitor Farm Programme Manager Beth Alexander from Quality Meat Scot* said: “The benefits of the programme extend well beyond the gates of the individual Monitor Farms.
“An initial meeting takes place at each farm and these are open to the whole farming community, who are very much welcome to come along and join the discussions.
“We want the learnings and the example set by Monitor farms to benefit all farmers across the whole of Scot*.”
The latest round of MFP was launched in summer 2022 and runs until 2026.
Background
The Monitor Farm Scot* initiative is managed by Quality Meat Scot* and AHDB Cereals and Oilseeds with funding from the Scottish-Government.
Now approaching its 20th anniversary, the MFP is the Scottish-Government’s principal farmer-led initiative
Each Monitor Farm will work closely with the Programme Manager, Regional Adviser, the farm staff and trusted advisers to establish the baseline technical, environmental, and financial performance of the farm business.
Each of the monitor farms will also have its own dedicated Management Team that will evaluate solutions and best practice before sharing its findings, both with the wider Community Groups and more generally through various media channels including a dedicated website.
The nine farms are located in: South Ayrshire, Strathspey, Banff and Buchan, Deeside, Stirlingshire, Roxburghshire, Dumfries, East Lothian and Argyll.            ",16/11/2022,Supporting agricultural innovation

                        Calls for inflationary uplift to Scot*Budget.
                    

A return to austerity would have significant consequences for people and public services, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has warned ahead of the UK Government’s Autumn Statement.
Mr Swinney has called for an alternative to austerity to avoid the UK Government “prolonging” the recession that the Bank of England forecasts may be the longest in 100 years.
The Deputy First Minister’s other urgent priorities include:
inflationary increases to devolved governments’ 2022-23 budgets to support people, fair public sector pay uplifts and public services
increasing social security benefits in line with inflation in the new financial year, with an immediate and permanent £25 uplift to Universal Credit and a reversal of the two-child limit and benefits cap
retaining the triple lock on pensions
introducing an enhanced windfall tax to fund support for those most in need
Mr Swinney said:
“The UK Government must not repeat the mistakes of the past. Scot* has already suffered a decade of UK Government imposed austerity which has disproportionately hurt the poorest and most vulnerable in society – it does not work and will inflict misery on people, put pressure on our public services and hamper our economy.
“With the UK forecast to enter recession in the coming months – one the Bank of England warns may be the longest in 100 years – cutting public spending risks prolonging that recession, hampering efforts to restore the public finances. The Chancellor must rule this out and pursue an alternative to austerity that invests in public services and the economy.
“We are facing exceptional challenges – a cost of living crisis, soaring inflation and a Scottish-Government Budget which is worth £1.7 billion less than when it was introduced last December. An additional inflationary increase in the block grant is needed to support us in addressing these challenges, as part of an overall approach that balances long-term fiscal sustainability with the increases in public spending that are needed.”
“The prospects for next year and beyond are very concerning. Reductions in UK departmental spending on the scale that is being trailed would have severe knock-on impacts on the Scot*Budget and our public services. It is vital that the Chancellor takes steps to ensure that people are supported, public services are protected and devolved governments have the funding to deliver for the communities we serve.”
Background
On 2 November, the Deputy First Minister announced the outcome of the Scottish-Government’s Emergency Budget Review, which set out £1.2 billion of savings to balance the Budget and direct resources to those who need help most in the cost of living crisis.

                        Extension opens benefit to more than 400,000 children.
                    

The Scot*Child Payment has today been increased to £25 and been extended to include eligible children up to age 16.
First launched in February 2021 at £10 per week per child for children under the age of six, the Scot*Child Payment - unique to Scot* - provides direct financial support to eligible families and carers.
Around 104,000 children already getting the payment will automatically see the payment increase to £25 per week – which represents a 150% increase within eight months. This is also the rate for all those now eligible up to age 16.
Following today’s extension, it is forecast that a further 300,000 children across the country will be eligible.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon today encouraged all eligible families to apply on a visit to Golfhill Primary and Whitehill Secondary schools at their shared campus in Dennistoun, Glasgow.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
“This is an important day for many families across Scot* as we make significant extra financial support available to tackle child poverty. The Scot*Child Payment is unique to Scot* and is the most ambitious child poverty reduction measure in the UK.
“At a time when the cost of living crisis is causing significant hardship for many families, this increased payment of £1300 per eligible child is even more vital, and the age extension means that it is now available to many more children.
“We want to make sure that everyone gets the help available to them. Parents or carers who are on universal credit or other benefits and who have children under 16 should check through Social Security Scot* if they are eligible.”
John Dickie, Director of Child Poverty Action Group in Scot*, said:
“The roll-out of the Scot*Child Payment to over fives and the increase in its value to £25 a week marks a hugely welcome day for struggling families across Scot* and a real step on the road toward ending child poverty.
“This is a significant and uniquely Scot*boost to family incomes at a time when it is needed more than ever. It’s now vital that we all spread the word as widely as possible and ensure that all eligible families apply and every child that is entitled benefits.”
 
Background
Scot*Child Payment is part of a wider package of five family payments including: Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment, Best Start Grant Early Learning Payment, Best Start Grant School Age Payment and Best Start Foods
Plans have also been announced to automatically pay the Best Start Grant Early Learning and School Age Payments to parents and carers who already receive Scot*Child Payment when their children become eligible. The change will be introduced later this month
The Scottish-Government estimates that the extended and increased payment could lift 50,000 children out of poverty in 2023/24, a reduction of five percentage points according to the latest Scottish-Government forecasts issued in March.
Ahead of today’s Scot*Child Payment extension and increase, the Scottish-Government introduced bridging payments worth £520 a year to provide immediate support to around 145,000 children and young people of school age. A doubled payment of £260 will be made to eligible people in December.
Families, and carers can find out more and apply at mygov.scot/scottishchildpayment or by calling Social Security Scot* free on 0800 182 2222
Given the large numbers, the Scottish-Government is expecting a high number of applications. This means that eligible people applying for the first time might need to wait to get their payment, with all payments calculated from the day they applied.
Families who already get Scot*Child Payment for a child under the age of six can add older children to their existing award.

                        Joint letter to UK Government.
                    

The UK Government has been urged to increase the amount of funding available for NHS pay.
Ahead of the Autumn statement, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf and Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan have written to UK Health Secretary Steve Barclay to ask for additional funding to help avert strike action this winter in the NHS.
The letter reads:
“We wanted to write to you in advance of the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement on 17th November to once again make the case for additional funding for our hardworking NHS staff.
“In recent weeks the Deputy First Minister of Scot* and the Welsh Government Minister for Finance and Local Government have written to His Majesty’s Treasury to make clear the need for additional funding for public services.
“The Royal College of Nursing have announced a sweeping legal mandate for industrial action across the UK. In Scot*, they have joined several other unions representing NHS staff in gaining a legal mandate for industrial action with ballots expected to confirm a mandate in the rest of the UK.
“The risk to the NHS of industrial action this winter is profound, and we all need to do all we can to avert industrial action in any form. The NHS across the UK continues to feel the effects of the pandemic as it recovers and remobilises, and any action is likely to have catastrophic effects in all parts of the UK.    
“We are experiencing a cost of living crisis and the anger of NHS staff is entirely understandable. Sky rocketing inflation combined with high interest rates, a direct result of the havoc caused by the UK Government’s mini-budget, means that we are simply unable to come close to matching the expectations of NHS staff across the country. While the support provided by the UK Government on areas such as support for energy bills is welcome, it has not gone nearly far enough.
“Media reports suggest that the Chancellor is considering reimposing austerity on the people of the UK again, for which there is no mandate, through extensive spending cuts. That would be a disaster for our public services, including the NHS, at a time when they need more investment, not less.
“We would therefore implore you to work with us to make the case to the Chancellor in advance of his Autumn Statement for increased funding for the NHS and the devolved governments as a whole, primarily to pay our hard working NHS staff a fair pay rise in the face of the cost of living crisis this winter, and avoid what could be catastrophic industrial action in the NHS.”

Families of more than 83,200 children are saving around £5,000 per eligible child per year, thanks to the Scottish-Government’s Early Learning and Childcare (ELC) offer.
Latest figures show a year-on-year increase in children accessing funded ELC.
The number taking up the full offer of 1,140 hours a year is also up from this time last year. If families paid for this themselves, it would cost them around £5,000 per eligible child per year.
A total of 93,902 children aged two to five were accessing funded ELC at the start of September – a 3% rise from the same time last year. Of those, 83,237 - 89% - were benefiting from the 1,140 hours offer.

“Scot* is the only part of the UK to offer 1,140 hours a year of funded early learning and childcare to all three and four-year-olds and eligible two-year-olds.
“This offer saves families a significant amount of money, which is particularly important at a time when so many are struggling with cost of living pressures. It also supports parents into work, training or study.
“High-quality ELC benefits children, too, by enriching their early years and giving them the confidence and skills they need to prepare them for school.
“We intend to expand our childcare offer even further, including building a future system of school age childcare and a new early learning and childcare offer for one and two-year-olds, starting with those who need it most.”
COSLA Children and Young People Spokesperson Councillor Tony Buchanan said: 
“I’m pleased that today’s figures confirm that nearly 94,000 two to five-year-old children are accessing funded Early Learning and Childcare delivered by Scot*’s Councils and their partners, which represents a 3% increase on the position a year ago.
“A greater proportion of children are accessing the full 1,140 hours entitlement, compared with April this year. The increased availability of funded ELC is allowing children more time to play and learn, and more opportunities for parents and carers to work, study or volunteer, as well significant financial savings for families at a time when this is so desperately needed.” 
Background
Early Learning and Childcare Delivery Progress Report
In August 2021, 90,890 children were in funded childcare, with 79,262 - 87% - accessing 1,140 hours.
The total number of children eligible for funded ELC increases throughout the academic year as more children turn three years old.
Legislation came into effect on 1 August 2021 to make the expanded offer of 1,140 hours available across Scot*.

Measures announced today will provide further help to those most impacted by the cost of living crisis while tackling budget pressures caused by rising inflation and economic uncertainty.
The Emergency Budget Review (EBR) for 2022-23 identifies funding of around £35 million for a range of initiatives to support people with the increased cost of living, including doubling the Fuel Insecurity Fund, doubling the Scot*Child Bridging Payment to £260 and a new £1.4 million Island Cost Crisis Emergency Fund to help island households manage higher energy costs.
Significant investment in public sector pay deals – delivering higher increases in pay for low earners – is also designed to help families and individuals deal with the cost of living crisis.
Other measures include:
confirming funds to local authorities to support Discretionary Housing Payments
establishing a Joint Taskforce with business, COSLA, local authorities and agencies to consider the differing impacts of regulation on business
extending energy advice to businesses by investing £300,000 to expand the services of Business Energy Scot*, while doubling the value of the SME energy efficiency Loan and Cash Back Scheme for energy efficiency to £20,000
new payment break options to help protect those who have agreed to repay debt through the Debt Arrangement Scheme but face unexpected increases in the cost of living
Additional savings of £615 million have been identified to enable enhanced public sector pay offers to be made while maintaining a route to complying with Ministers’ responsibility to balance the budget. They follow savings of £560 million announced on 7 September.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said:
“There has never been a time of greater pressure on the public finances.
“The Scottish-Government's budget today is worth £1.7 billion less than when it was published last December. At the same time, demand for government support and intervention is understandably increasing while we continue to try to fund increased public sector pay claims, particularly for those on lowest incomes.
“These savings are not ones we would wish to make, but in the absence of additional funding from the UK Government, we are left with no alternative. 
“We must balance the books while prioritising funding to help families, back business, provide fair pay awards and to protect the delivery of public services. This Emergency Budget Review delivers on these objectives.”

                        Figures show continued trust in the Scottish-Government.
                    

Three-quarters (75%) of people in Scot* believe the Scottish-Government should have the most influence over the way the country is run, compared to just 14% who believe the UK Government should.
This year’s Scot*Social Attitudes Survey also shows 66% of people trust the Scottish-Government to work in the country’s best interests.
The survey measured the public’s views on a range of issues including influence over how Scot* is run, levels of tax and government priorities, the economy, NHS and political engagement.
Its findings reflect emerging public concern in the cost of living crisis, with 66% of respondents believing the economy had got weaker in the previous 12 months.
The survey has previously been conducted face to face but as a result of coronavirus restrictions in place at the time of fieldwork, this year’s survey was completed via telephone.
This change in methodology has impacted the nature of the sample and responses received, and as a result has affected comparability with survey data from previous years. This year’s report solely focusses on data from this year’s survey rather than examining trends over time.
The findings also show:
64% of people thought the level of taxation and spending on health, education and social benefits should be increased, whilst 32% thought the level of taxation and spending should stay the same
68% agreed that income should be redistributed from the better-off to those who are less well-off, while 16% disagreed
over half of people (54%) in Scot* were satisfied with the way NHS Scot* is run
98% of people thought it was important to vote in Scot*Parliament elections, 95% in local council elections and 92% in UK Government elections
64% of people thought the Scot*Parliament was giving Scot* a stronger voice in the UK and only 7% thought it was giving Scot* a weaker voice
Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson said:
“The findings in this survey demonstrate continued faith in the Scottish-Government to deliver on behalf of the people of Scot*. They clearly show that despite these uncertain times, people agree with the Scottish-Government’s priorities to build a fairer, greener, wealthier Scot*.
“Despite these figures being from earlier in the year it is clear the cost of living crisis was starting to impact family finances and alarm bells were ringing about the economy. The Scottish-Government is working tirelessly to provide support to those who need it most. We are increasing the Scot*Child Payment to £25 per week and extending it to eligible children under 16 in the coming weeks, helping thousands of additional families this winter. We are also continuing to urge the UK Government to take all of the necessary steps to support the most vulnerable through this profoundly difficult time.
“Given the clear democratic mandate we have, not to mention the continued trust the public has in the Scottish-Government to act in their interest, we will work to ensure people have a choice on independence, ensuring that choice is an informed one.”

                        New annual publication provides estimates of benefit take-up rates.
                    

A new annual publication with estimated take-up rates of Scot*social security benefits has been published for the first time.
The report will help track progress against the Scottish-Government’s Benefit Take-up Strategy which is a requirement of the 2018 Social Security (Scot*) Act.
The Scottish-Government is committed to delivering a transparent social security system and reporting annually on progress will support that aim. This first publication covers estimates from introduction of the benefits up to the end of March in the 2021-2022 financial year and will sit alongside existing performance reporting on Social Security Scot*.
Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
“We are committed to making sure everyone gets the financial support they are entitled to and our benefit take-up strategy outlines how we are doing this. We actively work to encourage take-up of Scot*social security benefits by promoting our 12 benefits, collaborating with various organisations and removing barriers to access.
“This new publication of estimated take-up rates provides us with valuable insights, and will help us to identify where we can do more. Our commitment to continuous improvement ensures we are making progress in breaking down the barriers to access, and in reducing stigma that may have previously led to people not accessing the benefits they are entitled to.
“For example, we have been working with supermarket retailers to promote Best Start Foods, we have shared over 42,000 leaflets about our five family payments and Child Disability Payment in NHS Scot*’s baby boxes, and we have included information on Scot*social security benefits in welcome packs supporting refugees.
“Our efforts to maximise incomes and support benefit take-up are even more important during the current cost of living crisis. Our new cost of living website is a trusted ‘one stop shop’ for advice and information about financial support available in Scot*, including all our Scot*benefits. I would encourage everyone to use and share this website, to make sure people are accessing the financial support they are entitled to.” 
Background:

A take-up rate is the percentage of people entitled to a benefit that actually receive it. While the number of people receiving Scot*social security benefits is known through published official statistics, the number of people eligible to receive these benefits has to be estimated internally by Scottish-Government analysts using a range of data sources. This means the take-up rates in this publication are estimates only.

A record proportion of employees in Scot* are being paid the real Living Wage (rLW) or more, new figures reveal.
The Office for National Statistics’ Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings shows 91% of employees aged 18 and over earned at least the rLW in 2022, an increase from 85.5% in 2021 and the highest proportion since the rLW series began in 2012.
In comparison, 87.5% of employees aged 18 and over in England are paid the rLW or more, 88.2% in Wales and 85.4% in Northern Ireland.
The ONS survey also confirms that the Gender Pay Gap is lower in Scot* than across the UK as a whole. For full-time employees the gap is 3.7% compared with the UK figure of  8.3%.
The Scottish-Government is committed to tackling the cost of living crisis with a Fair Work approach, ensuring workers are paid at least the rLW - currently £10.90 per hour - and supporting more women into jobs through flexible working opportunities.
Minister for Employment and Fair Work Richard Lochhead said:
“The Scottish-Government’s commitment to promoting payment of the real Living Wage is a fundamental part of our National Strategy for Economic Transformation and a key cost of living policy to deliver a fairer and more equal society.
“The ONS figures confirm that Scot*employers are leading the way and we can be proud of the progress that has been made.
“There is still work to be done on tackling the gender pay gap, but we are taking steps to make this happen. We will publish our refreshed Fair Work Action Plan later this year, outlining the actions needed to close the gap further and create a more diverse and inclusive workplace. We will continue to work with employers, employability providers and partners to achieve this aim.”

The Survey’s estimates are for April 2022 when the rLW rate was £9.90 - and £11.05 for employees in London. The rate of £10.90 for employees outside London was announced in September 2022. Employers should implement the rise as soon as possible but have until May 2023 to implement it. Find out more on the real Living Wage here.

                        Rents frozen and evictions prevented.
                    

Emergency legislation giving tenants increased protection from rent increases and evictions during the cost of living crisis has become law after receiving Royal Assent.
The Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Act gives Ministers temporary power to cap rent increases for private and social tenants, as well as for student accommodation.
This applies to in-tenancy rent increases, with the cap set at 0% from 6 September 2022 until at least 31 March 2023, effectively freezing rents for most tenants during this period.
Enforcement of eviction actions resulting from the cost crisis are prevented over the same period except in a number of specified circumstances, and damages for unlawful evictions have been increased to a maximum of 36 months’ worth of rent.
Tenants’ Rights Minister Patrick Harvie said:
“Many people who rent their homes are facing real difficulties as a result of the cost of living crisis. While bills are rising for all of us, many tenants are more exposed as they are more likely to be on low incomes or living in poverty than other people.
“These measures aim to give tenants greater confidence about their housing costs and the security of a stable home.
“Some landlords may be feeling the effects of this crisis too. So while the primary purpose is to protect tenants, the emergency measures also include safeguards for those landlords who may be impacted. 
“For anyone struggling with their rent, I would urge you to contact your landlord, an advice organisation or a tenants’ union to get help as early as possible.”

The Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scot*) Act was approved by the Scot*Parliament on 6 October. It delivers a Programme for Government commitment.

                        All NHS workers offered £2,205 pay rise.
                    

NHS staff are set to receive a record pay rise of £2,205 - an average 7% pay uplift - to help tackle the cost of living crisis and retain staff during the tougher winter months. 
This increased offer was made after constructive negotiations between the Scottish-Government and NHS Unions, which lasted into the early hours of Friday morning (21 October).
The offer would mean the lowest paid seeing a rise of more than 11%, with qualified nursing staff receiving up to 8.45%, helping the lowest paid staff through the cost of living crisis. 
If agreed, the pay uplift, which amounts to almost half a billion pounds (£480m), will benefit more than 160,000 employees including nurses, paramedics, allied health professionals and healthcare support staff.  
This is the largest pay offer given to NHS Scot* Agenda for Change staff since devolution and will mean they remain the best paid in the UK. If accepted, the offer will be backdated to 1 April 2022, and could be added to pay cheques in time for Christmas.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said:
“I am grateful to trade union colleagues and NHS employers for constructive discussions on pay. This has been another exceptionally challenging year for our health service and we have a difficult winter ahead, but I am pleased that we are able to recognise the service and dedication of our healthcare and support staff with this pay offer.
“We owe NHS staff a debt of gratitude for leading us through the greatest public health crisis in recent history.
“This improved pay offer – which is the largest of its kind since devolution - reflects their hard work and will go a long way to help them through the cost of living crisis. We are rightly focussing the biggest increases for those who are the lowest paid, as we know the cost crisis is impacting them disproportionately.”            ",21/10/2022,Record pay offer for NHS staff

                        First Minister convenes second summit with energy companies and advice organisations.
                    

Further actions to support consumers and businesses through the winter have been agreed at a virtual summit between energy companies and advice organisations and Ministers.
The energy cost crisis summit discussed this week’s reversals to UK Government measures set out since the previous summit, and agreed longer-term certainty is urgently needed ahead of the anticipated energy price cap increase, currently due in April.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
“The curtailing of the Energy Price Guarantee by the Chancellor of the Exchequer earlier this week has eradicated what meagre certainty people and businesses had over their bills and finances in the short to medium-term. Even the current cap of £2,500 until April – while better than a rise to £3,500 – is still a very significant increase for households who are already struggling to pay their bills and heat their homes. Without further mitigation the increase to £2,500 under the Energy Price Guarantee will see an additional 150,000 households in extreme fuel poverty.
“The deficiencies in the UK Government’s package mean we are still in an emergency situation. The economic outlook has been made far worse by other aspects of the mini-budget – most of which have now had to be reversed entirely.
“The Scottish-Government is working hard within its limited powers and finite budget to support people, business, public services and the economy. Part of that work will involve ongoing engagement with energy companies and advice organisations throughout the winter to see how, individually and collectively, we can alleviate the huge challenges people are facing as well as signposting existing schemes and support that is available.
“It is clear however that more substantial reform of the energy market is needed to address the issue in the long term, and the power to do so lies with the UK Government.”
Background
Scot*Energy Retail Summit: update on collaborative action - gov.scot (www.gov.scot)
In October, the UK Government announced the Energy Price Guarantee for domestic consumers and the Energy Bills Relief Scheme for businesses. Following these announcements, the group reconvened on 20 October to discuss the implications on suppliers, advice organisations, the third sector, businesses and consumers, including those off-grid who are not part of an energy supply contract.
The following themes were identified for the Scottish-Government, energy suppliers, advice organisations and business groups to explore in more detail moving forward:
The Scottish-Government will work with Energy UK and other organisations to increase smart meter coverage in Scot*, with a particular focus on rural areas
partners will share data with the Scottish-Government to help inform calls upon the UK Government, to provide clarity on continued support for domestic and non-domestic consumers as soon as possible
The Scottish-Government will work with the business sector to explore how businesses can be supported with energy costs, within our devolved powers
ensuring maximum coordination of energy efficiency information and advice services to all consumers
To fully realise the aims of these work streams the Scottish-Government has called on the UK Government to take further action with a particular focus on:
accelerating the review of the Energy Price Guarantee scheme to ensure domestic consumers have clarity on energy costs after 31 March next year
additional targeted support to be delivered to support vulnerable consumers who are already struggling to pay their bills and heat their homes
doing more to support households across Scot* who rely on alternative fuels to heat their homes
clarify protections for businesses following 31 of March 2023 as soon as possible to ensure businesses in Scot* have the certainty and security they need to operate with confidence, while identifying 'vulnerable non domestic customers' and offering all vulnerable SME’s guaranteed support past March 2023

                        Paper outlines plans for fairer labour market.
                    

A new single rate for the national minimum wage to reflect the increased cost of living, and more effective employment law to protect workers’ rights underpin plans to build a fairer labour market in an independent Scot*, according to Deputy First Minister John Swinney.
Following publication of the paper Building a New Scot*: A stronger economy with independence, Mr Swinney said the powers of independence would allow the Scottish-Government to build a fairer, more equal future for all workers. This includes new measures to improve access to flexible working and better industrial relations.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said:
“Improving job security, wages and work-life balance are essential to delivering a more socially just Scot*. The UK labour market model has generated high income inequality while failing to drive productivity growth.
“Compared to independent European countries similar to Scot*, the UK has a higher prevalence of low pay, a bigger gender pay gap, longer working hours and significantly lower statutory sick pay.
“The Scottish-Government is committed to Fair Work, but we could go much further to strengthen that agenda in an independent Scot*, developing a legal framework that more effectively addresses the workplace challenges of the 21st century. It would give us an opportunity to redesign the system to better meet the needs of Scot*’s workers and employers.”
Specific measures proposed in the paper include:
establishing a Scot*Fair Pay Commission to lead a new approach to setting a national minimum wage, working with employers, trade unions and government
improving pay and conditions with a single rate minimum wage for all age groups and better access to flexible work to help parents and carers
repealing the UK Trade Union Act 2016 as part of developing an approach to industrial relations which suits both workers and employers
introducing a law to help workers organise co-operative buyouts or rescues when a business is up for sale or under threat
legislating to support workers in precarious employment, and banning the practice of staff being made redundant and re-hired on reduced wages and conditions
increasing transparency in pay reporting and data to address gender, ethnicity and disability pay gaps and building on Scottish-Government work to break down barriers to employment
The paper outlines how it would be easier for an independent Scot* to deal with labour market shocks. In responding to the global financial crisis and pandemic, other countries were able to quickly draw on existing institutions and initiatives. This could include a permanent short-time working scheme, modelled on the German Kurzarbeit programme which provides compensation for private sector workers whose hours are reduced because of economic difficulty. A scheme like this in Scot* could help retain skills, reduce long-term unemployment and the associated costs and allow for more rapid economic recovery.
Job Security Councils, modelled on a Swedish initiative, could provide support to workers who have lost – or are at risk of losing – their jobs. These non-profit foundations led by social partners, employer representative bodies and trades unions, would help workers find new employment by providing a range of advice and high-quality retraining.

                        First Minister announces doubling of December Bridging Payment to £260.
                    

Families of an estimated 145,000 children will benefit from extra support this winter to help with cost of living pressures – backed by Scottish-Government investment of £18.9 million.
Bridging Payments were introduced in 2021 ahead of the extension of the Scot*Child Payment to 6-15 year olds. The final quarterly Bridging Payment, due in December, will now be doubled to £260, meaning families will receive up to £650 per eligible child this year.
All children registered to receive free school meals on the basis of family low income are eligible and will receive this payment automatically.
Total Scottish-Government funding for the Bridging Payments will increase to an estimated £169 million across 2021 and 2022.
This is in addition to the Scot*Child Payment which will be extended to all eligible under-16s from 14 November and will rise to £25 per child per week on the same date – a 150% increase in the benefit within eight months.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
“I am proud of the work the Scottish-Government is doing to tackle child poverty. The Scot*Child Payment is paid to eligible families and is unique in the United Kingdom. It started for under-6s at £10 per week per eligible child. In April we doubled it to £20.  Five weeks from today we will increase it again, to £25 and will also extend it to families with children up to age 16.
“That is vital financial help for well over 100,000 children, delivered in time for Christmas. That is the sign of a government with the right priorities.
“But we need to do more because we know this winter is going to be really tough. Rather than looking forward to Christmas, too many families will be dreading it because they don’t know if they can afford to heat their homes or even pay for food.
“As part of our help to the poorest families over last year and this, ahead of rolling out the Scot*Child Payment to under 16s, we have made quarterly bridging payments of £130 to children and young people in receipt of free school meals.
“I am delighted that the Scottish-Government will double the December Payment from £130 to £260.
“That will help put food on the Christmas table for families of 145,000 children and young people. I don’t pretend it will make all of their worries go away – no government with our limited powers can ever do that. But I hope this investment of almost £20 million will bring a bit of Christmas cheer to those who need it most.”
Background
Bridging Payments were introduced in 2021 ahead of the roll out of the Scot*Child Payment to under 16s. The £130 payments are paid quarterly by councils on behalf of the Scottish-Government. Families received up to £520 per eligible child in 2021 and will receive up to £650 in 2022. Bridging Payments support around 145,000 school age children.
The Scottish-Government will make available additional funds to double the December payment. Delivery is subject to approval by COSLA Leaders.
Scot* is the only nation in the UK offering the Scot*Child Payment, one of five family benefits delivered by the Scottish-Government to support low income parents with the costs of raising a child. Scot*Child Payment is currently available to families of eligible children under 6 years old and will open to applications for under 16s from 14 November.

A veterans support fund is now open to help improve the lives of former service personnel and their families.
A key priority for this year’s Scot*Veterans Fund is to make sure veterans and their families are supported in response to the ongoing cost of living crisis.
The fund will also target support for veterans who have left the Services early, as well as promoting collaboration between both veterans charities and non-veterans organisations.
Since the Scottish-Government created the fund in 2008 almost 200 individual projects have been supported, receiving more than £2.3 million. In 2021, the annual funding provided was more than doubled to £500,000, with individual projects now able to bid for up to £50,000 a year.
Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Veterans, Keith Brown said:
“Scot*’s veterans community has given a great deal to society and it is right that we do all we can to provide the best possible care and support when they return to civilian life.
“It is important that the fund responds to issues that veterans are currently facing and this year we are looking to support projects that will help veterans and their families through the cost of living crisis.
“We will continue to target projects that provide new and innovative approaches to aiding our veterans community. In particular, bids that promote collaboration within and between the veterans charity sector and other non-veterans organisations, as well as support for early service leavers, are being prioritised.”
Scot*Veterans Commissioner Susie Hamilton, who chairs the independent panel that assesses bids for the Fund, said:
“I am delighted to see the continuation of this support to those leaving the Service, veterans and their families. The priorities of supporting vulnerable early service leavers and those most affected by the current cost crisis are particularly welcome and important in the current difficult circumstances. Organisations working together can produce a powerful impact, so I hope to see collaboration and partnerships feature in this year’s applications.
""We all benefit when veterans and their families are able to prosper after military service and I look forward to seeing the range of bids that will be put forward to help make that happen.”

                        Emergency legislation approved by MSPs.
                    

Tenants will have increased protection from rent increases and evictions during the cost of living crisis under temporary legislation passed by the Scot*Parliament.
The Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Bill gives Ministers temporary power to cap rents for private and social tenants, as well as for student accommodation. The Bill also introduces a moratorium on evictions.
This cap, which applies to in-tenancy rent increases, has initially been set at 0% from 6 September 2022 until at least 31 March 2023. Ministers have the power to vary the rent cap while it is in force. The measures can be extended over two further six-month periods.
Enforcement of eviction actions resulting from the cost crisis are prevented over the same period except in a number of specified circumstances, and damages for unlawful evictions have been increased to a maximum of 36 months’ worth of rent.
The temporary legislation balances the protections that are needed for tenants with some safeguards for those landlords who may also be impacted by the cost crisis.
Tenants’ Rights Minister Patrick Harvie said:
“I am pleased that Parliament has passed this Bill to support tenants through the current cost of living crisis. People who rent their home are more likely to live in poverty or be on low incomes than other people, and many will be anxious about keeping up payments on their homes as their everyday expenses rise.
“With this Bill now set to become law, tenants in the social or private rented sector, or in student accommodation, will have stability in their homes and housing costs.
“I’m hugely grateful to MSPs for scrutinising and agreeing this legislation this week, ensuring these protections can be brought in with the urgency that this crisis demands.”

The 2023-24 Scot*Budget will be published on 15 December 2022, the Deputy First Minister John Swinney has confirmed following agreement between the Scottish-Government and the Scot*Parliament’s Finance and Public Administration Committee (FPAC).
The agreed date provides certainty of Scot*’s plans and supports the Scot*Parliament to scrutinise the Scottish-Government’s spending plans for the next financial year.
In a letter to FPAC, Mr Swinney highlighted that the Scot*Fiscal Commission requires at least 10 weeks to prepare spending forecasts and said the “uncertainty and volatility of UK Government’s plans” means the Budget may need to be revisited if there are implications for this period.
Mr Swinney said:
“There is no doubt that the challenges and obstacles of recent times have heavily impacted the way we live. Our continued recovery from the pandemic, the current cost of living crisis, the ongoing turmoil and uncertainty regarding the UK Government’s plans for its Autumn budget and Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine all have implications on the people of Scot* and our economy.
“We are not privy to discussions surrounding the UK Government’s ever changing Autumn budget plans, despite the clear and obvious impact this has on our ability to plan our 2023-24 Budget. The Scot*Budget will be informed by voices across Scot* to ensure we continue to deliver to build a fairer, greener and more prosperous country.
“I look forward to working with stakeholders and the Committee to ensure a Budget is delivered which puts the priorities of the Scot*people at the forefront and continues to strengthen our economy.”

                        Support highlighted during Challenge Poverty Week.
                    

Families and friends have a crucial role to play in ensuring Scot*’s social security payments reach those who need them most.
On a visit to a Citizens Advice Bureau, as part of Challenge Poverty Week, Social Security Minister Ben Macpherson said talking about benefits would help drive take-up and reduce stigma about accessing benefits. The Scottish-Government urges people to make sure they get the benefits they are entitled to.
These payments provide support to people on low incomes, people with disabilities, carers, and young people entering the workplace.
During the visit to the Citizens Advice Bureau in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Mr Macpherson met staff and volunteers who provide information and advice about available financial assistance and wider support.
 Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
“We are urging as many people as possible to talk to family, friends and other people they know to encourage them to apply for benefits they may be entitled to. We want people to get any support that they are eligible for.
“We know that word of mouth helps to raise awareness of Social Security Scot*’s payments, and those provided by the UK Government which may be needed to access Scot*benefits. We also want anyone who thinks they might be eligible for payments to check what’s available to them.
“While several of our payments are designed for people on low incomes there are also others which provide support to disabled people, young people starting their careers after a period of unemployment, and carers including young carers.
“Social security is a shared investment in people and supports building a fairer, more equal society. The current cost of living crisis shows that any of us could need this support at some point in our lives. That is why it is right that we invest in social security together.
“The Scottish-Government is grateful for the impactful role that Citizens Advice advisers play in promoting and supporting access to social security.”
Citizens Advice Edinburgh Chief Executive Benjamin Napier said: 
""The Citizens Advice network in Scot* encourages everyone to check that they are receiving the income they are entitled to.
“Every year, millions of pounds of welfare entitlement go unclaimed. At a time of increasing costs and pressures on household budgets, we strongly encourage people to get in touch with their local Citizens Advice Bureau or use our online tools like www.moneymap.scot to see if they could be receiving more money. Last year the CAB network across Scot* helped over 174,000 people and 2.4 million people checked our online advice pages. 
“Advice from CABs is free, impartial and confidential. We never charge people for advice and are for everyone regardless of background or circumstance. Social Security Scot* have 12 new benefits and we want to make sure everyone knows their rights of access them.”

                        More than £600 million to support services.
                    

Additional funding of £8 million for overseas nurse recruitment and increased flexibility for Health Boards to retain staff are among new measures to support the health and care system through what is anticipated to be an extremely challenging winter.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has outlined a number of actions for the coming months backed by more than £600 million of funding.
Measures to support services include:
recruitment of 1,000 additional staff over the course of this winter, including £8 million to recruit up to 750 nurses, midwives and allied health professionals from overseas as well as 250 support staff across acute, primary care and mental health;
flexibility for Health Boards to offer ‘pension recycling’, where unused employer contributions can be paid as additional salary, to support the retention of staff;
£45 million for the Scot*Ambulance Service to support on-going recruitment, service development and winter planning;
£124 million to assist health and social care partnerships expand care at home capacity;  
extension of the Social Care Staff Support Fund to 31 March 2023, to ensure staff receive full pay when in COVID isolation;
Writing to GPs to communicate the expectation that pre-bookable appointments are made available in every practice, alongside same day, face to face and remote appointments;
The first annual update has also been published on the NHS Recovery Plan which highlights significant progress made in the last year, including increasing NHS workforce to historically high levels, the success of the COVID vaccination programme, and a marked reduction in outpatient waits of over two years.
Mr Yousaf said:
“NHS Scot*’s staffing and funding is already at historically high levels, but as we approach the winter period it is crucial that we look to maximise, and enhance where we can, the capacity of the NHS. Given the scale of the escalating cost of living crisis, combined with the continued uncertainty posed by COVID and a possible resurgence of Flu, this winter will be one of the most challenging our NHS has ever faced.
“These measures will support winter resilience across our health and care system, ensuring people get the right care they need at the right time and in the most appropriate setting. We will also expand our workforce, particularly registered nurses to assist with the expected increase in workload. We have jointly agreed a number of overarching priorities with Cosla which will help guide our services this winter. We are on course to double our virtual capacity this year and so far have avoided or saved bed days equivalent to adding a large district general hospital.
“We have published the first update on our NHS Recovery Plan which highlights just how much progress we have made in the past year, I am determined to build on this and we will report on progress annually.  
“Our NHS and social care staff have shown remarkable resilience in the face of sustained pressure on services and I would like to thank them for their continued commitment and hard work. As we approach the Winter period their efforts will be vital in ensuring we deliver high quality care for the public.
“To help relieve pressure on services, people should continue to consider whether their condition is an emergency before going to A&E. Local GPs and pharmacies can be contacted during the day for non-critical care, NHS 24 is also available on 111 for non-emergencies.”

Payments to support Scot*farming businesses through the current financial crisis have exceeded targets by three months.
Payments have been issued to more than 14,200 businesses, totalling £328 million.
Sharp rises in energy, fuel and fertiliser costs for the agriculture sector prompted legislative changes to allow early payment of Scottish-Government support schemes.
The legislative changes came into effect on 18 September and work to process payments began the next working day.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: “I am acutely aware that businesses across Scot* are facing a hugely challenging increase in their bills and we have moved quickly to help relieve inflationary pressures and protect jobs across our world-leading food and drink sector.
“We announced in June that farm payment dates would be brought forward to September in an effort to support Scot*’s farmers with cash flow and the cost of living crisis and we have delivered on our promise.
“The first tranche of payments have substantially exceeded forecasts and are significantly ahead of previous years.”
Annually, the Scottish-Government pays out around £420 million through the Basic Payment Scheme and Greening payments.
This year, the Scottish-Government’s farm payment strategy will see a transition away from providing manual loan payments to automated scheme advance payments.

                        Bill to freeze rents and safeguard against evictions.
                    

Emergency legislation laid before the Scot*Parliament today seeks to increase protection for tenants from rent rises and eviction action during the cost of living crisis.
If approved, the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scot*) Bill will give Ministers temporary power to cap rents for private and social tenancies, with this cap set at 0% – effectively freezing rents – from 6 September 2022 until at least 31 March 2023. The Bill includes the further power to maintain or vary the rent cap over two further six-month periods.
Enforcement of eviction actions resulting from the cost crisis will be prevented over the same period except in a number of specified circumstances. Damages for unlawful evictions will be increased to a maximum of 36 months’ worth of rent.
These measures will also apply to students in college or university halls of residence or other types of purpose-built accommodation.
The legislation includes safeguards for private sector landlords, allowing them to apply to increase rent to partially cover a limited number of specific costs including increased mortgage interest payments on the property they are letting, an increase in landlords’ insurance or increases in service charges paid as part of a tenancy, subject to an overall limit.
Safeguards for both social and private sector landlords, as well as providers of college and university halls and other purpose-built student accommodation, are included in the Bill’s provisions on evictions.
Tenants’ Rights Minister Patrick Harvie said:
“The cost-of-living crisis is an emergency situation demanding an emergency response. Even as energy, food bills and other day-to-day basics become more expensive, today’s legislation freezing rents and protecting tenants from eviction will give tenants stability in their homes and confidence about their housing costs.
“People who rent their homes are more likely to live in poverty or be on low incomes than homeowners. As such they are particularly exposed to rising prices, and it is imperative that we bring in support for them urgently.
“We know that many landlords have been doing what they can to protect their tenants, but some tenants are being hit with large rent increases that are hard to justify. This legislation aims to protect all tenants from substantial increases, balancing the protections that are urgently needed for tenants with safeguards for those landlords who may also be impacted by the cost crisis.”

Deputy First Minister John Swinney and his counterparts from other devolved governments are seeking an urgent meeting with Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng to discuss immediate actions needed to reverse the damaging effects of the UK Government’s tax proposals.
Mr Swinney and the Finance Ministers from Wales and Northern Ireland are highlighting the profound impact of “the largest set of unfunded tax cuts for the rich in over 50 years” warning that it is “a huge gamble on public finances and the health of our economy”.  
In a joint letter to Mr Kwarteng, they warn against being condemned to another decade of austerity and express deep concern over reports that UK Government departments will be asked to make spending cuts to balance the budget, which may have profound consequences for devolved budget settlements already eroded by inflation.
The Ministers also renew calls for the UK Government to provide targeted support for households and businesses, funded through a windfall tax on the energy sector. In addition, they call for Social Security benefits to be increased, and request additional resources for the devolved governments to protect public services and to fund public sector pay settlements.

                        Leading economists to give expert advice.
                    

Members of an expert panel providing advice to the Scottish-Government as part of its Emergency Budget Review (EBR) have been confirmed.
Sir Anton Muscatelli, Professor Frances Ruane and Professor Mike Brewer will assess the impact on Scot* of the UK Chancellor’s fiscal approach and held their first meeting with Deputy First Minister John Swinney today.
Their advice will enable timely consideration of the implications of the UK Government’s fiscal event as work continues to prioritise the Scottish-Government’s budget towards tackling the cost of living crisis. The Deputy First Minister has announced he will report the results of the EBR in the week beginning 24 October.
Mr Swinney said:
“The Scottish-Government wants to make sure it gets the very best advice and fresh perspectives as Ministers consider the complex and difficult decisions we face while tackling the challenges ahead.
“The radical shift in UK economic policy announced by the Chancellor has already caused significant economic shock.
“For the benefit of the people and businesses of Scot*, many of whom will find themselves paying higher prices as a result, it is vital that we consider the current situation and potential solutions with care.
“The members of the panel all bring robust economic insight and I am grateful to them for giving their time and expertise as we navigate these uncharted economic waters.”

                        New website provides ‘one stop shop’ for advice and information.
                    

A new website providing information on the wide range of advice and financial support available to people in Scot* has been launched.

Developed by the Scottish-Government as a ‘one stop shop’ to help those struggling with the cost of living crisis, the website includes information on help available for households to meet rising energy, housing and other costs.

It also provides details on accessing Scot*and UK social security payments, including online benefit calculators, as well as wider health and wellbeing information.

A Programme for Government 2022-23 commitment, it will be supported by a nationwide media campaign to raise awareness of the website and signpost people impacted by rising costs to the help available.

The website was launched by Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison during a visit to debt help service in Tollcross, Edinburgh, run by charity Christians Against Poverty.

Shona Robison said:

“I know that people are struggling with the cost of living crisis right now and may not know where to turn for help. Our cost of living website is a trustworthy online resource with information on the wide range of vital support available.

“No one should feel alone in this crisis and this website, along with our campaign, aims to encourage people to find out if they are eligible for the extensive support available to access the advice they need. We want everyone to get all the financial support and help that is available so I would encourage people to apply for the payments they are entitled to – it might be just the lifeline that is needed right now.

“We have allocated almost £3 billion in this financial year to contribute towards mitigating the increased cost of living crisis and the new website highlights the wide range of support at hand. Our package spans a range of support, for energy bills, childcare, health and travel, as well as social security payments that are not available anywhere else in the UK. The website is an important signpost towards them all.

“The cost of living crisis is impacting every household in the UK and the Scottish-Government will continue to do everything within its powers and finite budget to ensure people are supported as far as possible.”

Scot* National Director for Christians Against Poverty, Emma Jackson, said: “We are deeply concerned about the impact of rising costs on low income households. Even before rising costs, over a third (36%) of CAP clients had to borrow to meet essential living costs and we know the consequences of problem debt can be devastating for people.

“The new cost of living website from the Scottish-Government is a welcome step in helping people to find and access all the vital support that is available to them, including steps to maximise income. People need to know help is available. Now, more than ever, we need to take every action possible to support households who are being hit the hardest by the cost of living crisis.”

Claire (not her real name) is a single parent from Edinburgh who experienced problem debt after her son was born prematurely. She spent a lot of time at the hospital and his health and wellbeing was her primary focus. Due to the stress of this situation she wasn’t able to manage bills or work to earn money and debts began to mount.

Claire’s debt had a significant impact on her mental health. She lived in fear of debt collectors coming to the door and hid the letters in a drawer as she didn’t know how she would be able to pay them. She felt ashamed and embarrassed and for a long time she didn’t know where to turn.

Problem debt had such an impact on Claire’s mental health that she tried to take her own life twice. Claire heard about Christians Against Poverty through her local foodbank and once she met her debt coach she felt like a weight had been lifted and she was able to laugh again. She felt like CAP was her safe place and her befriender became like a mother to her.

Claire was able to go debt free in December 2021, however, she is still struggling on a low income. She already has to travel quite far to shop around and find the cheapest items. She is worried about how she will be able to keep going with rising costs.

She explained: “It’s unbelievable what things cost at the moment, it’s all gone up so much – food, electric, clothes for my son. It all costs so much and right now, I just don’t know how I am going to afford it all. I’ve worked hard to get back on track with my finances, but there isn’t enough to pay for all of these essential things that I need for my son. I don’t want to be in debt again.”

Deputy First Minister John Swinney told the Scot*Parliament that further time was required to consider the implications of the UK Government’s tax changes and he would report the results of the review in the week beginning 24 October.
The EBR will outline how resources will be redirected to tackle the cost of living crisis. In light of the UK Government’s mini-budget last Friday and the significant economic instability which has followed, advice will be sought on the implications for Scot*.
Mr Swinney said:
“The Chancellor’s statement provided little respite for many families who are already facing a winter unable to afford essentials like food and heating. The UK Government needed to use its reserved powers to help those who need it most – but instead we got tax cuts for the rich and not much for anyone else.
“The Chancellor is taking a huge gamble on public finances and the health of our economy. And the markets have reacted strongly – the pound fell to record lows on Monday, the cost of government borrowing has risen to its highest level in over a decade and investor confidence is plummeting.
“The Scottish-Government is doing everything within its powers to support people, public services and the economy but these efforts are under threat by the UK Government’s new and dangerous race to the bottom. That is not a race we are willing to run. We will not be replicating the UK Government’s tax cuts but will consider carefully the correct measures for Scot*.
“It is vital that we give proper time to consider the serious implications for Scot* of the UK mini Budget before we conclude our Emergency Budget Review. I intend to seek advice from an expert panel and also to embark on discussions with businesses and trade unions. The Scot*Fiscal Commission will incorporate the impact of the changes in their next forecasts.”

                        Deputy First Minister says statement is ‘cold comfort for many'.
                    

The Chancellor’s fiscal statement and package of announcements targets the most wealthy, shifting further pressure onto the shoulders of those on the lowest incomes, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said.
Reacting to the statement, Mr Swinney expressed his disappointment that while many households across Scot* are already struggling to pay their bills and heat their homes, the measures offer tax cuts for corporations and bankers.
The Deputy First Minister said:
“The Chancellor’s statement today will provide cold comfort to the millions of people across Scot* who have been looking for the UK Government to use its reserved powers to provide support for those that need it most. Instead we get tax cuts for the rich and little for those who need it most.
“We estimate that the increase in the price cap to £2,500 will force an estimated 150,000 more Scot*households into extreme fuel poverty. Instead of offering these people support, the Chancellor is threatening to cut their family budgets further, with a new regime of benefit sanctions.
“On Land and Buildings Transaction Tax and on Scot*income tax, the Scottish-Government will set out its plans as part of the normal budget process. We will discuss the proposed investment zones with the UK Government but we are clear they have to be the right fit for Scot*.
“Because of inflation, the Scottish-Government’s budget is worth £1.7 billion less than it was when we set it in December, yet the Chancellor has refused to provide a single additional penny for public services or increase public sector pay.
“We are doing everything within our power to support people, public services and the economy, but these efforts are under threat by a reckless UK Government beginning a new, and dangerous race to the bottom. With a fixed Budget and no scope to borrow for short term challenges, Scot* is at the mercy of UK decisions. This reinforces the urgent need for independence.”

The UK Government is being urged by the devolved governments to fund its cap on energy prices through a windfall tax, not higher borrowing.

In a joint letter to the new Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng, Deputy First Minister John Swinney is joined by Finance Ministers from Wales and Northern Ireland in calling for more targeted support to those impacted the most by the cost of living crisis.

They express their concern that more action is needed to prevent further hardship for households and businesses and say support “should be funded by targeting the windfall gains in the energy sector rather than passing on the cost through higher borrowing”.

The Finance Ministers also call for additional funding to support vital public services in the face of rising prices, energy costs and wage pressures as devolved settlements are worth considerably less in real terms than last October when they were set.

The joint letter reads:

Dear Kwasi,

We want to jointly congratulate you on your new role as Chancellor of the Exchequer. We are committed to working constructively with you and the new UK Government. A productive working relationship will be essential to tackle the economic crisis facing our citizens, communities and businesses.

We wrote to your predecessor on 15 July outlining our considerable concerns with the worsening economic situation in the UK including the cost crisis, funding for public sector pay and the impact of inflation on the Devolved Governments’ budgets. Our letter has been included as an annex here.

The Prime Minister’s announcement of 8 September limiting increases in energy bills will alleviate some of the anticipated additional pressures on households and businesses. However, it is important to recognise that overall this is an expensive package of measures that does not target support to those who need it most. We are deeply concerned at who will bear the brunt of these costs. Support should be funded by targeting the windfall gains in the energy sector rather than passing the cost to households through higher borrowing. 

Looking ahead to your forthcoming fiscal statement, we urge you to focus efforts on those most impacted, not just relying on blanket interventions which do not recognise the scale of hardship particular households are facing.  An extended and targeted support package needs to be provided to help those who, even with the cap, are facing the impossible choice between heating their homes and feeding themselves and their loved ones. Even with the price cap, energy costs are still double what they were last year.

In addition to households, early clarity and additional support is also required for businesses and the third sector, who are facing substantial challenges. The current measures provide businesses with only a temporary respite and little certainty to help them plan for the future. Many organisations would be forced to close if they are not supported. 

Ministers in the Devolved Governments have exhausted the options available to us to address the cost crisis, stretching every pound available to us to provide support. The main levers that can make a difference are held by the UK Government and it must now take urgent steps to use these to provide much needed certainty to those suffering hardship and poverty.

The crisis has also resulted in a major squeeze on funding for public services and increases in demand. Additional funding is urgently needed to support our vital public services in the face of rising prices, energy costs and wage pressures, alongside unforeseen pressures. Based on recent inflation and widespread inflationary expectations for the next year or two, our respective three-year spending review settlements are worth considerably, potentially billions, less in real terms than when we received them last October. 

Further, Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has resulted in many Ukrainians seeking safety across the UK, however it is necessary to increase the funding available to support them here. In particular, there is a lack of parity in the funding available for those arriving under the Ukraine Family Scheme and the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme, which cannot be right. ‘Thank You Payments’ to host families should also, in line with Lord Harrington’s recommendation, be doubled to ensure that those who have opened their homes to Ukrainians do not lose out financially as a result.

We would welcome early engagement and clarity on planned fiscal events to enable us to set out the implications for the devolved nations and effectively plan our own budgets, which are significantly impacted by UK spending and tax decisions.

Collaborative working between the UK Government and the Devolved Governments in a spirit of mutual respect would be of benefit to all of us.

Given that, now overdue, action is required to tackle the crisis we propose a quadrilateral meeting with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury as soon as possible and in advance of the FISC to agree the immediate steps that must be taken to tackle this issue and support households, businesses and the public sector.

On 15 July 2022, the Finance Ministers for the devolved governments wrote to the then Chancellor outlining economic areas of concern, including the cost of living, public sector pay and wider spending pressures.            ",21/09/2022,Call for targeted action on soaring energy bills

                        Half a billion savings identified to tackle cost crisis.
                    

 
Around £500 million in savings have been found as resources are focused on tackling the “harsh reality” of the cost of living crisis, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said.
He updated the Scot*Parliament on steps being taken to meet the increased costs of public sector pay and to provide support to those who need it most, while balancing public finances.
Soaring inflation means the Scottish-Government’s budget is now worth £1.7 billion less in real terms than it was last December. Since then inflation has risen from around 4% to more than 10% – with possible further increases when figures come out next week.
Mr Swinney set out to Parliament where savings have so far been made to help pay for initiatives such as fair public sector pay settlements and doubling the Fuel Insecurity Fund. He has also written to the Finance and Public Administration Committee outlining the details of reductions in planned spending made in recent weeks.
The Deputy First Minister has committed to setting out the Emergency Budget Review within two weeks of the UK Government budget update expected later this month. He warned further intervention will represent a significant challenge given the largely fixed Scottish-Government budget and limited fiscal powers.
Mr Swinney said:
“Our budget was based on a UK Spending Review that simply did not foresee the levels of inflation that are now a reality.
“That alone would require the budget to be revisited.  But in times of crisis the job of the finance secretary is not simply to balance the books. It is to find the money to help families, to back business and to fund the priority projects that improve lives for the long term. And so, the Emergency Budget Review must both identify funding to cope with inflation-driven cost increases and aim to support those who most need our help during this crisis.
“This is the harsh reality of a fixed budget and limited powers. The Scottish-Government simply does not have access to many of the levers which would provide the greatest support in this crisis. We will do everything we can. We will make the hard choices. But only the UK Government can act to end this crisis. They should do so – and I encourage them to do so now.”

A combined rent freeze and moratorium on evictions to help people through the cost crisis has been announced as the centrepiece of the 2022-23 Programme for Government (PfG).
The programme outlines emergency legislation which will be introduced to put in place a rent freeze until at least 31 March 2023 and a moratorium on evictions, as well as a new tenants’ rights campaign. In addition a ‘one-stop-shop’ website will be introduced to provide people with information on the range of benefits and support available to help them through the current cost of living crisis.
With £3 billion allocated to the end of March for a range of support that will help mitigate the impact of the cost crisis on households, the PfG also confirms the Scot*Child Payment will increase to £25 per week per eligible child from 14 November when it also opens to all under 16s.
In addition, the programme includes the roll out of free school meals across all primary school age groups, doubles the Fuel Insecurity Fund to £20 million to help households at risk of self-disconnection or self-rationing of energy, confirms rail fares will be frozen until March 2023 and widens the Warmer Homes Fuel Poverty Programme.
For businesses – in addition to an existing package of financial aid worth over £800 million – six ground-breaking ‘tech scalers’ will be opened, two job-boosting Greenports progressed and the National Strategy for Economic Transformation focussing on economy supporting measures continued.
In total, the PfG sets out 18 new Bills including legislation on an independence referendum and major reforms in the justice system, including a Criminal Justice Reform Bill that will propose the end of the Not Proven verdict in Scots Law and provide anonymity for complainers in sexual offence cases.  A Bill for the creation of the new National Care Service will also go through parliament this year.
The programme also builds on long-term commitments made in the Bute House Agreement and restates Ministers’ commitment to the importance of delivering on Scot*’s climate ambitions. These range from a consultation on legislation to transform how buildings are heated to continuing record investment in active travel.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
“This Programme for Government is published in the context of the most severe cost crisis in many of our lifetimes. It is a crisis pushing millions into poverty and poses a genuine danger, not just to livelihoods, but to lives.
“The Scottish-Government is already committed to a range of measures, worth almost £3 billion this year, that will help with rising costs. But the magnitude of what is being experienced by people and businesses means that mitigation is nowhere near sufficient. What is needed now is action on a scale similar to the initial Covid response.
“Regrettably, the powers to act in the manner and on the scale needed do not lie with this Parliament. In my view, they should lie here. If they did, we could have acted already. But they don’t. These powers are reserved to Westminster.
“The cost crisis means this Programme for Government is more focussed than ever before – deliberately so – with priority actions to provide help now.
“To that end we will provide more help for people who may be at risk of self-rationing or even self-disconnection from their energy supply and we will double the Fuel Insecurity Fund to £20 million this year.
“We will also propose emergency legislation to put in place a rent freeze until at least March and a moratorium on evictions.
“Given the powers to act in the manner and on the scale needed do not lie with this Parliament, this Programme for Government also provides for a Scot*Independence Referendum Bill. Independence would give us – like it does other independent countries – the levers we desperately need to respond to a crisis such as this. That’s the prize we surely must grasp.”

                        Funding package to improve island infrastructure.
                    

Six island local authorities will receive a share of £4.45 million to assist critical projects on climate change, population retention and tourism.
A total of 11 projects, spread across 31 islands, have received funding for the current financial year as part of the Islands Programme.
Projects include a new visitor centre and EV charging points at Old Man of Storr, nine ‘Island Pit Stops’ at Arran and Cumbrae providing better facilities for visitors, a new nursery at Kirkwall to replace an existing building earmarked for demolition and improvement of critical sea front infrastructure at Tobermory.
Announcing the funding during her visit to Orkney, Islands Secretary Mairi Gougeon said:
“This is an important investment especially given the consequences of the cost of living crisis and climate change which are of particular concern for our islands. This investment will go some way in helping us support our island communities.
“I am happy to be here in Orkney, to announce the allocation of £1.5 million to the Orkney Islands Council for a brand new nursery facility. The new nursery will support families from both mainland Orkney and the outer isles, as well as providing opportunities for Childhood Practice Students from Orkney College. 
“I wish all the successful projects the very best and look forward to following their progress.”
Scot*Futures Trust is providing support and feedback for the projects. The funding is part of the Islands Programme, which supports the implementation of the 2019 National Islands Plan, helping to make the Scot*islands even better places to live, study, work and raise a family.
Councillor Gwenda Shearer Chair of Orkney Islands Council’s Education, Leisure and Housing Committee said:
“The funding allocation for the new nursery facility is fantastic news. The stated purpose of the fund is to improve quality of life in our island areas – and improved access to child care facilities for our local families really does tick that box. 
“The new facility will make an enormous difference locally and we are looking forward to progressing the project.”
Tony Rose, Director for Strategy, Scot*Futures Trust said: 
“Our infrastructure experts have been working with Scottish-Government and the six island local authorities to ensure the Islands Programme delivers positive outcomes for island communities.
“This funding will now be invested in much-needed community infrastructure such as a low carbon children’s nursery and a circular economy social enterprise venture, that will support repopulation, economic growth and local jobs. Our focus now is on working with the successful applicants to see their projects come to fruition and achieve what the communities need.”
BACKGROUND:
The 2022/23 Islands Programme (IP) was launched on 21 March 2022, with an application deadline of 10 June 2022.  It is being delivered in partnership with local government via a competitive bid process with the six island Local Authorities as lead applicants.
Applications to the IP have been subject to scrutiny and assessment by the Islands Programme Investment Panel which has made recommendations on projects to be funded.  The panel is selected from Scottish-Government and a range of partner organisations who have experience of panel assessments and infrastructure spending.

Detail of Approved Projects 
Argyll and Bute Council
Island Community Halls Digital Hubs, £100,000. Coll, Iona, Islay, Tiree. Argyll and Bute Council.
This project will create four digital hubs in island community halls for a variety of uses including hybrid meetings, access for online services and NHS “Near Me” clinics.  It will act as a pathfinder for other potential sites across other islands and build on experiences from the pandemic to provide inclusive digital access and a reduction in travelling time, costs and emissions.
Tobermory Seawall and Railings Improvements, £250,000. Mull.
This project will provide critical sea front infrastructure to the community of Tobermory by adding resilience against tidal surges and helping to reduce the impact of climate change. The work will also support the sustainability of existing businesses and provide a safer and more welcoming environment.
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar
Ionad Hiort – RIBA Stage 4 design fees, £167,000. Lewis. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.
The Ionad Hiort/ St Kilda Centre project aims to build a £6.25m visitor centre in Uig in the Isle of Lewis.  This application is for RIBA stage 4 work which will provide the necessary detailed specifications to progress to the tender stage.  Ionad Hiort has been recognized by the UNESCO World Heritage Centre as a global exemplar for remote access to the hundreds of World Heritage Sites where visitor access in large numbers is either impossible or undesirable. The project aims to provide critical employment thereby supporting retention and growth in population and will contribute to re-invigorating a living Gaidhlig community.
Community Facilities Programme – Uist, £347,781. Berneray, North Uist, Eriskay.
The Community Facilities Regeneration Programme is a series of three regeneration projects for a community hall; reconfiguring a building into a digital co-working space and safeguarding another community building prior to establishing a community hub. The programme will have significant impacts in future proofing each group’s facilities while increasing the level of service provision. The energy efficiency measures taken with incorporation of Renewable Energy solutions will lead to a dramatic reduction annually in carbon emissions across the three projects.
The Highland Council 
Old Surgery Housing Enablement, £72,000. Eigg.
This project will deliver the enabling ground works, bore hole and electricity connections in preparation for the main construction phase of two new homes in as timely a manner as possible.  This project has strong links to population retention and growth, housing and will use off grid and renewable energy connections. The application is focused solely on infrastructure to “unlock” the site, comprising a new, robust water supply and establishing an electrical connection to Eigg Electric Ltd (Eigg’s Green Energy Grid).
The Old Man of Storr, £440,000. Skye.
The ambition of the overall project is to deliver a world class experience for visitors to the Old Man of Storr that showcases Skye’s unique heritage and culture. This application is focused on the provision of a retail/visitor unit on-site and EV charging points.  There are strong links with sustainability, education, and sustainable economic development in addition to increased awareness of Gaelic and local culture.
North Ayrshire Council
Regeneration of Millport Town Hall – phase 2, £509,450. Cumbrae.
Phase 2 of a multi-funded development to use the building’s basement to provide a central community space, delivering a package of activities and attractions within a heritage building. The renovated space will provide additional operational income to sustain the project and extend options for use. The project has high levels of community involvement, partnership working and builds on previous investment. Natural light, solar panels and air source heat pumps will provide a significant amount of the building’s energy and LED lighting. New conservation standard double-glazed windows and insulation will be installed.
Island Pit Stops, £540,000. Arran and Cumbrae.
This project seeks to manage the challenges of increased visitor numbers by re-purposing and improving existing infrastructure to encourage visitor dispersal and cope with over-visitation at key sites. It aims to increase the quality of the visitors’ experience by providing better facilities, thereby supporting increased dwell time and spend on the islands. Island toilet buildings will be redeveloped into accessible and eco designed Island Pit stops across nine locations.  This project provides a replicable example of sustainable tourism.
Orkney Islands Council 
New Kirkwall Nursery, £1,500,000. Mainland Orkney.
New build nursery facility located next to Orkney College campus, to replace an existing building earmarked for demolition and which is the only current nursery facility in Orkney.  The project has strong links to population retention, addressing child poverty and meeting net zero ambitions.  The proposed nursery is located adjacent to Orkney College, leading to opportunities to support Childhood Practice Students as they develop their skills, therefore supporting a key sector which has had recruitment challenges. The new-build facility will save approx. 20 tonnes of CO2 in moving the nursery service from the old 1960 CLASP building to the new highly insulated building.
Shetland Islands Council
Aald Skul Enterprise Development £88,095. Mainland Shetland.
By investing in a new portable cabin, additional access and parking, this social enterprise in a small community will be able to expand the range and volume of repaired, donated items offered for sale. This project is a strong replicable example of working towards net zero ambitions in a remote community and is a clear model of the circular economy in action. The Scrapstore strives to meet net zero ambitions through reducing travel and energy associated with disposing of goods which are still in good/repairable condition or with travelling to buy new items.  This can help to reduce overall household expenses, and influence perception that the community can be an affordable place to live in comparison to other areas and centres.
Papa Stour Kirk Development £252,505.  Papa Stour. Shetland Islands Council.
This second phase of a three-phase project will help safeguard and improve the building fabric of Papa Stour Kirk, the only community facility on the island.  The work will protect the building for continued use and provide a stepping stone ultimately to a new community hub and visitor centre.  There are strong links to supporting NIP Strategic Objective 10 empowered local communities and incorporates net zero ambitions.

                        Cost crisis high on the agenda.
                    

A new group established to help Scot*’s retail sector as it recovers from the pandemic has discussed soaring energy costs and the impact of Brexit.
At its first meeting, the Retail Industry Leadership Group (RILG) also considered how to deliver the Scottish-Government’s Retail Strategy and began drafting priorities to help businesses grow.
The Group is co-chaired by the Minister for Public Finance, Planning and Community Wealth Tom Arthur and the Chief Operating Officer of the John Lewis Partnership, Andrew Murphy. It comprises senior business representatives, trades unions and industry groups.
It will work with the Scottish-Government to help the retail sector meet current and longer term challenges while becoming stronger and more resilient. Fair Work and achieving Net Zero goals will underpin the group’s work.
Mr Arthur said:
“This first meeting of the Retail Industry Leadership Group was timely given the cost crisis we are facing and allowed us to learn more about the impact on retail businesses, staff and customers. Implementing the Retail Strategy can help the sector seize opportunities, deal with longer term trends, and recover from immediate challenges.
“There is no single solution to helping retailers so, as we approach a challenging winter, it is essential the response from government at every level happens at speed, to address the nature and magnitude of the emergency. We support calls from businesses for measures related to energy prices, VAT reduction, staff shortages and handling business loans - direct support which falls within the reserved responsibilities of the UK Government.”
Co-chair and Chief Operating Officer of the John Lewis Partnership, Andrew Murphy said:
""I was encouraged by the positive and collaborative nature of our discussion. Given the scale and nature of the collective challenges we are all facing, this is both timely and vital.
“There was a shared concern around the impact inflation is having on suppliers, employees, customers and our communities through the current cost of living crisis. It is clear that both retailers and the Scottish-Government continue to work hard to find ways to provide more support where they can.
""I'm excited by the evident enthusiasm of the Leadership Group to drive forward the implementation of the Retail Strategy. Fair Work, the skills agenda and the importance of retail in delivering high quality town and city centres are uppermost in our minds as we look ahead to the next few months.""
Background
The Scottish-Government Resilience committee (SGoRR) is meeting weekly to consider the cost crisis. The action being taken by the Scottish-Government was set out by the First Minister’s statement on 11 August.
Establishing an Industry Leadership Group was a key action in the Scottish-Government’s Retail Strategy to promote recovery. Read more on Getting the Right Change: A Retail Strategy for Scot*.
The Group will also focus on encouraging retail businesses to demonstrate their commitment to Fair Work principles; harnessing opportunities in the National Strategy for Economic Transformation that will directly support the retail sector; making the sector responsive to changing consumer behaviours; overseeing development of a Skills Audit and Action Plan; and developing a Just Transition Plan to guide retail towards Net Zero.
