07/02/2023,"Over 8 million families in the UK will continue to receive direct financial support from Government, with the first of five Cost of Living Payments – worth £301 – hitting bank accounts this spring.","
    
          Over 8 million families in the UK on means-tested benefits will automatically receive £301 this Spring, and over 6.5 million people on disability benefits in the country will receive a £150 payment this summer
  £301 payment is the first of five direct cost of living payments for the most vulnerable households, including pensioners and disabled people, with the total amount of support reaching up to £1,350
  Full breakdown released showing recipients of Cost of Living and disability payments by local authority and parliamentary constituency
After confirming the payment schedule for five cost of living payments through the 2023/24 financial year, The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has today announced in Parliament more detail on the support.

This includes estimates of how many people across the UK, and in each local authority and parliamentary constituency, will receive the first £301 Cost of Living Payment and the £150 Disability Payment, which follows on from up to £1,200 in support for low-income households in 2022.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Mel Stride said:


  These direct payments will help people right across the UK over this year and the start of the next, as we continue to provide consistent, targeted and substantial support for the most vulnerable.

  Our wider support package, including the Energy Price Guarantee, will ensure every household is being helped through this challenging period of high inflation, caused by Putin’s illegal war and the aftershocks of the pandemic.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt added:


  High inflation, exacerbated by Putin’s illegal war, is hurting economies across the world and making people poorer.

  These payments are the next part of the significant support we are providing through this challenging time, with millions of vulnerable households receiving £900 directly into their bank accounts this financial year alongside additional help for pensioners and those with disabilities.

  This latest payment will provide some temporary relief, but the best thing we can do to help families and businesses is to stick to the plan to halve inflation this year.


Exact payment windows and qualifying periods for eligibility will be announced in due course, but are designed to ensure a consistent support offer throughout the year. Payment windows will be broadly as follows:

£301 – First 2023/24 Cost of Living Payment – during Spring 2023
  £150 – 2023 Disability Payment – during Summer 2023
  £300 – Second 2023/24 Cost of Living Payment – during Autumn 2023
  £300 – 2023 Pensioner Payment – during Winter 2023/4
  £299 – Third 2023/24 Cost of Living Payment – during Spring 2024
There are several benefits that could make claimants eligible for the £301 Cost of Living Payment, including Universal Credit and tax credits – through which 5.4 million households across the UK are expected to qualify, and Pension Credit, through which 1.4 million pensioner households are expected to be paid. 1.3 million will be eligible through legacy DWP benefits such as Jobseekers Allowance and Income Support, reaching a total of 8.1 million households.

Eligible individuals do not need to apply for payments, as they are made automatically. Those eligible for cost of living payments through tax credits, and no other means-tested benefits, will be paid by HMRC shortly after DWP payments are made.

This builds on the government’s wider support package, which includes further funding for the Household Support Fund, bringing its total value for October 2021 to March 2024 to over £2 billion. The fund is distributed to English councils, who know their areas best and are then able to offer direct support for those most in need in their local area. Every household with a domestic electricity supply is also benefitting from the Energy Price Guarantee, which is saving the average household around £900 this winter and a further £500 in 2023/24 by capping energy costs.

Benefits will also rise in line with inflation from April, which will see a 10.1% increase for pensioners and those on the lowest incomes, whilst the National Living Wage will see its biggest ever cash rise, bringing it to £10.42 an hour.

This all follows on from 2022’s support package, which included:

A £650 Cost of Living Payment for means-tested benefit claimants, split into two payments, each of which supported over eight million households
  Further £300 and £150 payments, which reached over eight million pensioner households and six million disabled people respectively
  A £150 Council Tax rebate for all households in Council Tax bands A to D in England
  A £400 energy bill discount for all households, which will continue to run through March 2023"
03/01/2023,"Millions of the lowest-income households across the UK will get up to £1,350 from the Government in 2023/4 to help with the cost of living.","
    
          Millions will receive new cost of living support from Spring 2023, following up to £1,200 in support for over eight million low-income households in 2022
  £900 Cost of Living Payment for means-tested benefit claimants will go direct to bank accounts in three payments over the financial year
  Extra cash support for disabled people and pensioners will see some households receive extra cash
The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has today announced more detail on the payment schedule for the next round of cost of living support unveiled in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement, building on payments made to over eight million people in 2022.

The new £900 cash boost for over eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including those on Universal Credit, Pension Credit and tax credits, starts in Spring and will go direct to bank accounts in three payments over the course of the financial year. There will also be a separate £150 for over six million disabled people and £300 for over eight million pensioners on top of their Winter Fuel Payments.

Exact payment windows will be announced closer to the time, but are spread across a longer period to ensure a consistent support offering throughout the year. They will be broadly as follows:

£301 – First Cost of Living Payment – during Spring 2023
  £150 – Disability Payment – during Summer 2023
  £300 – Second Cost of Living Payment – during Autumn 2023
  £300 – Pensioner Payment – during Winter 2023/4
  £299 – Third Cost of Living Payment – during Spring 2024
Work and Pensions Secretary, Mel Stride said:


  We are sticking by our promise to protect the most vulnerable and these payments, worth hundreds of pounds, will provide vital support next year for those on the lowest incomes.



  The government’s wider support package has already helped more than eight million families as we continue to deal with the global consequences of Putin’s illegal war and the aftershocks of the pandemic.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt added:


  I know these are tough times for families across the UK who are struggling to meet rising food and energy costs, driven by the aftershocks of Covid and Putin’s war in Ukraine.



  That’s why we’re putting a further £900 into the pockets of over 8 million low income households next year. These payments are on top of above inflation increases to working-age benefits and the Energy Price Guarantee, which is insulating millions from even higher global gas prices.



  Tackling inflation is this government’s number one priority and is the only way to ease the strain of high prices, drive long term economic growth and improve living standards for everyone.


If individuals are eligible they will be paid automatically, and there will be no need to apply. Claimants who are eligible for any of the Cost of Living Payments and receive tax credits, and no other means-tested benefits, will receive payment from HMRC shortly after DWP payments are issued.

These payments build on the Government’s extensive support package to help households tackle the globally rising cost of living stemming from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

The Government’s Energy Price Guarantee continues to cap energy costs, saving the average household around £900 this winter and a further £500 in 2023/24. Benefits, including working age benefits and the State Pension, will also rise in line with inflation from April 2023, ensuring they increase by over 10%. April will also see the biggest ever cash rise to the National Living Wage, bringing it to £10.42 an hour, and a further year-long extension of the Household Support Fund in England and associated devolved nation funding worth £1 billion in total.

This comes on top of the 2022 support package, which included:

A £650 Cost of Living payment for means-tested benefit claimants, split into two payments, each of which supported over eight million households
  Further £300 and £150 payments, which reached over eight million pensioners and over six million disabled people respectively
  A £150 Council Tax rebate for all households in Council Tax bands A-D
  A £400 energy bill discount for all households, which will continue to run through March"
11/01/2023,Financial package to help students with living costs and a further freeze on tuition fees.,"
    
          
Multimillion pound package to help students cover living and other costs.
  Tuition fees frozen for next two years to reduce student debt levels
  Measures are part of government’s drive to support households with the cost of living
Students in need are to benefit from additional financial support designed to ease cost of living pressures and help them to meet everyday costs whilst they are completing their studies.

In recognition of the challenges some students have faced due to the global rise in inflation, the government has announced today (11 January) that it will provide an additional £15 million in hardship funding this financial year so that universities can provide extra support to students that need it most.

It builds on the significant £261 million that the government has already provided to the Office for Students (OfS) for the 2022/23 academic year which universities can draw upon to boost their own hardship funds.

Universities are responsible for ensuring students who need help get the support they need, including through their own hardship funds, or through bursaries and scholarships. Many universities have stepped up their efforts this year offering innovative schemes to support their students. Examples include:

The University of Southampton which has made a total of £1.1 million in the current academic year available to students to cover emergency costs,
  Queen Mary University of London which has a bursary scheme automatically provided to any domestic undergraduate from a family whose annual taxable income is below £20,000, and
  The University of York which announced that £150 would be given to student households who are finding it difficult to pay their bills as part of a £6 million package to support students most in need.
The government has also confirmed today that loans and grants to support undergraduate and postgraduate students with living and other costs will be increased by 2.8% for the 2023/24 academic year.

Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education Robert Halfon said:


  University is an investment, setting students up for future success, helping them to climb
the ladder of opportunity and gain invaluable skills for the world of work.

  We recognise students continue to face financial challenges, which is why we are
increasing loans and grants for living and other costs for a further year.  For the sixth year
in a row, we have frozen tuition fees for a full-time undergraduate course at a maximum of
£9,250 which will reduce the initial amount of debt students will take on.

  To support universities to top up their own hardship funds we are also making an
additional £15 million available. This will bring the total available to universities to draw on
in supporting their students in hardship to £276 million this academic year.

  I’m really pleased to see that so many universities are already stepping up efforts to
support their students through a variety of programmes. These schemes have already
helped students up and down the country and I urge anyone who is worried about their
circumstances to speak to their university.


For the sixth year in a row, the government has confirmed it will freeze tuition fees for a standard full-time course in the 2023/24 and 2024/25 academic year in England at a maximum of £9,250. This move will help provide better value for students by reducing the initial amount of debt students will take on.

The government regularly monitors the interest rates set on student loans against the interest rates prevailing on the market (PMR) for comparable loans. The government confirmed that the maximum Plan 2 and the Postgraduate loan interest rate will be 6.5% between 1 December 2022 and 28 February 2023.

From the 2023/24 academic year, the government will cut interest rates for new students to RPI only so that, under these terms, graduates will not repay more than they originally borrowed, when adjusted for inflation.

07/03/2023,£76 million tied up in forgotten accounts to be used to support people to get out of debt and assist social enterprises with innovative energy saving solutions.,"
    
          
Dormant Assets Scheme redirects money from forgotten accounts to good causes
  £76 million will go to those struggling with the cost of living, including through no-interest loans
  In England, Scheme is being expanded to include community wealth funds, pots of money that will allow local residents to improve their communities
The most vulnerable people in society will be given additional support to deal with the cost of living, as £76 million tied up in forgotten accounts is unlocked.

The cash will support people to get out of debt and assist social enterprises with innovative energy saving solutions.

Beneficiaries include no-interest loans for 69,000 individuals struggling with finances via a £45 million grant distributed by Fair4All Finance, and hundreds of charities and social enterprises which will receive support from a pot of £31 million, distributed by social investors Access and Big Society Capital. This will be used to retrofit premises with cleaner, greener, and more efficient energy systems, such as new boilers or heat pumps, solar panels, and new lighting.

Dormant assets are financial assets left untouched for long periods. Led by the financial services industry and backed by the government, the Dormant Assets Scheme aims to reunite people with these lost funds. Where this is not possible, it can be transferred to the Dormant Assets Scheme to be distributed to important social and environmental initiatives.

The Dormant Assets Scheme unlocks money from forgotten bank and building society accounts, and will soon include further assets from the insurance and pensions, investment and wealth management, and the securities sectors.

An estimated £738 million more will be made available over time thanks to the expansion of the Scheme to the new sectors.

Since 2011, £892 million has been released via the Scheme. In England, dormant assets money has been used to support young people, help those in financial difficulty, and generate social investment.

The government is also today announcing that community wealth funds will become an additional beneficiary of the Dormant Assets Scheme. A community wealth fund is a pot of money distributed to communities in deprived areas and released over a long time period, with local residents empowered to make decisions on how to use the money.

To ensure that local decision-making sits at the heart of a community wealth fund, the government will shortly launch a public consultation to gather public and industry views on the overarching design of this important new initiative.

Youth, social enterprises, and people in financial difficulty will continue to be supported, with previous beneficiaries including community centres and charities providing care for the socially isolated and elderly.

Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said:


  Today we are announcing that millions of pounds will be redirected from dormant accounts to help the most vulnerable in society deal with the cost of living.

  This will have a real impact on people’s lives, help alleviate debt and provide money saving solutions for charitable organisations.


DCMS Minister Stuart Andrew said:


  The public consultation on dormant assets funding provided people with the opportunity to name how money that will be unlocked should be spent, and I’m delighted to announce our plans to introduce a community wealth fund as a new cause.

  The creation of a community wealth fund will give local residents in some of the more deprived areas of the country the power to improve where they live and invest in what’s important to them.


David Knott, Chief Executive, The National Lottery Community Fund said:


  As the distributor of dormant assets, The National Lottery Community Fund sees first-hand the life changing difference this funding makes. I welcome the Government’s plans to include community wealth funds alongside existing causes. This reflects The National Lottery Community Fund’s experience of funding and supporting communities over decades. I look forward to turbo charging efforts through this expansion.


Jane Hanson, CBE, Chair, Reclaim Fund Ltd and Dormant Assets Expansion Board  said:


  The Government’s announcement on future dormant assets funding comes at a particularly important time given the pressures on so many households. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of the Dormant Assets Expansion Board, which brings together industry, government and regulators, the Scheme is now poised for expansion, which could result in £880 million in additional dormant assets funding to good causes across the UK. Reclaim Fund Ltd is making the final preparations to launch the expanded Scheme and we look forward to welcoming participants from the insurance and pensions sector, followed by other sectors, including investment and wealth management, later this year.


Kirsty Cooper, Champion for the Insurance and Pensions sector and Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, Aviva said:


  I’m delighted with the Government’s new announcement on future dormant assets funding. The expanded Scheme will help to make a real difference to the lives of those people who need it most across society, freeing up millions of pounds at a time when financial hardship is a real cause for concern, and I welcome the news that financial inclusion will receive additional funding to support this.


Reclaim Fund Ltd is making the final preparations to launch the expanded Scheme. This will welcome the first participants from the insurance and pensions sector in the coming months, with other sectors joining later this year.

The Dormant Assets Scheme has supported many projects across the country already. These include:

Following the pandemic, Chanctonbury Community Leisure in Storrington, West Sussex were provided with a £50,000 grant and £100,000 loan from CAF Venturesome which was partly used to install a new 3G pitch. This has become a major community asset with 20 local teams training each week on the facility, including a new girls’ football team and women’s football and rugby teams.
  Supported by Big Society Capital, The Greater Manchester Homes Partnership have enabled 355 of Greater Manchester’s homeless people to be housed.
  Youth Futures Foundation has supported 802 young people in the Greater Manchester region with employability skills, including through the Manchester Deaf Centre, which helps children and young people who are deaf, deaf/blind, or children of deaf adults and have experienced increased isolation due to Covid-19.
  Fair4All Finance has committed £25 million to the Affordable Credit Scale Up Programme, which is projected to help triple the availability of affordable credit to approximately £900 million by 2025.
  Big Society Capital committed £8.5 million to Black Country Reinvestment Society, which invests in local enterprises, such as Miss Macaroon, a social enterprise which reinvests 100% of its profits into helping unemployed young people gain employability skills.
  Access’s Growth Fund supported 41 projects across the Liverpool City Region with £3.7 million investment. This includes support for Homebaked, a co-operative bakery and community land trust based opposite Liverpool FC’s Anfield stadium, enabling them to meet growing demand through the development of a dedicated catering unit with specialised equipment and freeing up space in their own kitchens for classes for local children.

Notes to editors

A dormant asset is a financial product, such as a bank account, that the customer has not used for many years, and which the business has been unable to reunite them with, despite making efforts based on industry best practice.
  Dormant assets remain the property of their owners and the Scheme must match what the business would have paid the owner had their assets never been transferred into the Scheme. This means that owners can reclaim any money owed to them at any time.
  Under the Scheme, funds are held by Reclaim Fund Ltd (RFL). RFL is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, and holds sufficient money to cover any reclaims while distributing the surplus to The National Lottery Community Fund for social or environmental initiatives across the UK.
  The Scheme is dependent on the voluntary participation of businesses, who can choose to transfer money from the dormant assets they hold to Reclaim Fund Ltd.
  In 2022 it was announced that the Scheme would be expanded to include dormant assets in the insurance and pensions, investment and wealth management, and securities sectors, in addition to dormant bank and building society accounts. This is estimated to unlock a further £880 million over time, £738 million of which will be made available for England.
  Following a public consultation, the government intends to name youth, financial inclusion, social investment wholesalers, and community wealth funds as the four purposes of the English portion.
  The government aims to publish a statement of intent this year to announce the proportions of funding this government intends to allocate to the four causes, provided the Scheme secures sufficient participation. This will be based on an evidence-led analysis of need in the four sectors and where dormant assets funding could make a meaningful impact while remaining additional to Exchequer funding.
  No money can flow to a community wealth fund until this cause has been set in secondary legislation, as current legislation only permits the English portion to be spent on youth, financial inclusion, and social investment wholesalers. Secondary legislation will be laid as soon as the parliamentary timetable allows.
  No decisions have been made on how much funding will be awarded to a community wealth fund, or which organisation(s) will deliver it.
  Dormant assets money in England will continue to be available as funding for youth, financial inclusion, and social investment initiatives. Financial inclusion is defined as the development of individuals’ ability to manage their finances or the improvement of access to personal financial services. The government will explore how financial education and capability can additionally be supported in the future, in line with its broad definition. Alongside the Scheme’s work to increase availability of affordable financial products, this will aim to give people the tools and knowledge they need to better manage their money and understand financial terminology.
  Charities will continue to receive support for their energy bills until March 2024 under the government’s Energy Bills Discount Scheme, with a £18 billion package of energy support having been provided for organisations and businesses throughout this winter.
  This is in addition to wider support to help charities with their costs, including a reduction in VAT from 20% to 5%.
  The government also provided the sector with a £750 million package of Covid support for frontline charities - that supported more than 14,000 charities and reached an estimated 21.5 million people.
  In addition to the Energy Price Guarantee this winter, the government provided £1200 worth of support to the most vulnerable households for 2022-23:
    £650 in cost of living payments;
      £400 through the Energy Bill Support Scheme;
      £150 Council Tax rebate;
      Additional support for pensioners and those claiming disability benefits.
    
  The government has announced further support on the cost of living in 2023-24, targeted at those most in need:
    UK households on means-tested benefits will receive a further £900 Cost of Living Payment;
      Pensioner households across the UK will receive an additional £300 Cost of Living payment;
      People across the UK on non-means-tested disability benefits will receive a further £150 Disability Cost of Living payment, to help with the additional costs they face.
    
  DCMS is backing the country’s powerhouse sectors to grow the economy and make a difference where people live.
  The civil society sector is worth at least £16 billion to the UK economy. There are 951,000 jobs in the sector, over 50,000 more jobs than in 2019 before the pandemic.

Adrien Smith, OBE, Chief Executive, Reclaim Fund Ltd said:


  Over the past 12 years, thanks to the banks and building societies who participate in the Scheme, RFL has been able to release £892 million to dormant asset spend organisations. Every day, this money transforms lives, through initiatives in financial inclusion, youth and social investment. The Government’s commitment to continued funding in these areas will provide welcome assurance to Scheme participants, many of whom choose to participate as these causes are aligned with their social responsibility priorities.


Economic Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith said:


  I am thrilled that the Dormant Assets Scheme has reached this significant moment, with the expanded Scheme giving a substantial funding boost to financial inclusion. As City Minister, this is a priority, and I was pleased to recently have met with leaders across industry and charities to discuss how we make progress on this issue in the coming year. Today’s announcement is a reminder of the financial services sector’s vital role in combining economic growth with supporting communities in every part of the UK.

20/09/2022,From today (20 September) around six million disabled people in the UK will start to receive their one-off £150 Disability Cost of Living payment,"
    
          
    Six million people who are paid certain disability benefits will begin to receive a one-off payment of £150 from today
  
  
    Payments are part of the government’s wider £37 billion support package, including the Energy Price Guarantee and cost of living payments totalling £650
  
Those who had confirmed payment of their disability benefit for 25 May will receive the £150 automatically, with the vast majority to be paid by early October.

The payment will help disabled people with the rising cost of living, acknowledging the higher disability-related costs they often face, such as for care and mobility needs.

The cost of living payments from the government are part of a £37 billion package of support, which will see millions of households receive at least £1,200 this year to help cover rising costs, and follows the Prime Minister’s announcement of a new Energy Price Guarantee for the next two winters saving households on average £1,000 a year on their energy bills.

Work and Pensions Secretary Chloe Smith said:


  We know disabled people face additional costs and this government is listening and taking decisive action to protect the most vulnerable in our society.

  In addition to the £150 Disability Cost of Living payment, households will save an average of £1,000 a year through our new Energy Price Guarantee and the lowest-income households will receive at least £1,200 to help with the rising cost of living this year.

  This multi-billion-pound package of support reinforces our commitment to help UK households, particularly those with disability challenges, through the tough times ahead.


UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng said:


  The government is providing vital support to shield the most vulnerable from rising prices caused by global economic challenges.

  From today, a one-off £150 payment will automatically land in over six million disabled peoples’ accounts. This is in addition to the decisive action we took last week to hold down energy bills over the next two years, saving the average household £1,000 a year.

  The government is standing behind people this winter, and in the longer term we are focusing on driving economic growth – the only way to permanently boost everyone’s living standards.

08/12/2022,"The average Pension Credit award is worth over £3,500 a year and those who claim by 18 December could also be entitled to an extra £324 cost of living payment.","
    
          Minister for Pensions Laura Trott urges pensioners to check if they qualify for Pension Credit
  Claims can be made online and over the phone, with the Pension Credit calculator on hand to help pensioners see if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.
Minister for Pensions Laura Trott is today calling on pensioners across the country to check if they are entitled to Pension Credit as soon as possible to ensure they stand the best chance of qualifying for an extra £324 cost of living payment.

Checking eligibility and applying by 18 December 2022 – just ten days away – will mean pensioners could also receive a £324 boost thanks to Pension Credit backdating rules.

This is because successful Pension Credit claims can be backdated for up to 3 months – as long as the applicant was also eligible to receive it during that time.  The average Pension Credit award is worth over £3,500 a year and even a small Pension Credit award can provide access to a wide range of other benefits – such as help with housing costs, council tax or heating bills – in addition to the extra cost of living payments.

Minister for Pensions Laura Trott said:


  The run up to Christmas is always a busy time, but one thing to make sure that’s on your list over the coming days is to find out whether you or your loved ones could be eligible for Pension Credit.



  Pension Credit can make a real difference and I am determined to make sure this support – worth an average of £3,500 per year – is reaching everyone who needs it.


Pension Credit is designed to help people over State Pension age and on a low income with daily living costs, though you do not need to be in receipt of State Pension to receive it.

It tops up a person’s income to a minimum of £182.60 per week for single pensioners and to £278.70 for couples.
To ensure that a successful backdated claim falls within the qualifying period for the extra £324 cost of living help, eligible pensioners are being urged to claim Pension Credit as soon as possible, and by no later than 18 December 2022.

Currently, around 1.4 million pensioners in Britain receive Pension Credit. However, many are still not claiming this extra financial help.

One of those who recently claimed is Arthur from Lincolnshire. After learning about Pension Credit from his neighbour, Arthur successfully applied by calling the Pension Credit claim line on 0800 99 1234.

Arthur said:


  Highly delighted with the Pension Credit award we received – the money was quicker arriving than expected and all in all very pleased with the result. I’d really encourage other pensioners to check if they’re eligible – it’s made a real difference to me.


Pension Credit can be claimed by phone and online, ensuring that older people can apply safely and easily, wherever they are. The online Pension Credit calculator is also on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

Those being paid a qualifying disability benefit will be paid automatically from 20 September, with the vast majority of those eligible expected to receive their one-off payment within a couple of weeks by the beginning of October.

The payment will help disabled people with the rising Cost of Living acknowledging the higher disability-related costs they often face, such as care and mobility needs.

For those disabled people on low-incomes, this payment comes on top of other Cost of Living payments totalling £650, £400 for all households to help with energy bills, and an extra £150 for properties in Council Tax bands A-D in England.

Over eight million eligible households in receipt of a means-tested benefit received the first of two automatic Cost of Living payments of £326 from 14 July. The second means-tested payment of £324 will be issued later this year.

Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work Chloe Smith said:


  We know disabled people can face additional costs, which is why we are acting to help reduce the financial pressures on the most vulnerable.



  This £150 disability payment is on top of the £1,200 most low income benefit claimants will also receive and alongside wider support targeted at disabled people, including help with transport and prescription costs.



  We know it’s a worrying time for some people and I’d urge them to check they are getting all the support on offer by searching Help for Households.


The Cost of Living payments from the government are part of a £37 billion package of support, which will see millions of households receive at least £1,200 this year to help cover rising costs.

The government has also expanded support for the Household Support Fund in England – which helps people with food and energy bills – with an extra £421 million – for October 2022 to March 2023, and topped up funding by £79 million for devolved nations; the total value of this support now stands at £1.5 billion.

This is all in addition to changes to the Universal Credit taper rate and work allowances worth £1,000 a year on average for 1.7 million working claimants, a rise in the National Living Wage to £9.50 an hour, and a tax cut for around 30 million workers through a rise in National Insurance contribution thresholds.

UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi said:


  We know that rising prices faced by many countries around the world are a significant worry for many people here in the UK, especially those most vulnerable to additional costs.



  Today’s announcement that disabled people will begin to receive an additional £150 payment from the end of September reinforces our commitment to help UK households through the challenging times ahead.



  This payment is in addition to further help households can expect over the coming months – including a second cost of living payment of £324 for households on means-tested benefits, £300 for pensioners this winter and £400 discount on energy bills for every household. This is all part of our significant £37 billion support package.

20/12/2022,11.6 million Winter Fuel Payments and Pensioner Cost of Living Payments have been made to pensioners across the UK so far this winter.,"
    
          11.6 million Winter Fuel Payments and Pensioner Cost of Living Payments have been made to pensioners across the UK so far this winter.
  This means over 99 percent of eligible pensioners have already received up to £600 to help with their energy bills since the rollout began in November.
  Some payments are continuing into next month – and should arrive by 13 January.
11.6 million Winter Fuel Payments and Pensioner Cost of Living Payments – support worth a total of £4.6 billion – have already been made to pensioners across the UK this winter, the Department for Work and Pensions confirmed today.

The vast majority of these payments – worth up to £600 per household – have landed in pensioners’ bank accounts automatically, directly helping people manage their energy bills and household budgets.

Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said:


  As the cold weather bites, it is good to be able to confirm that over 99 percent of eligible pensioners have already received as much as £600 to help with their energy bills this winter.

  These payments are just one part of the wider support package we are delivering to help with rising bills, with additional help to follow next year – including the biggest State Pension increase in history.


Pensioners who have not yet received their payment should not be concerned, as payments are continuing into January.  However, pensioners who have not received their payments by 13 January 2023 should contact the Winter Fuel Payment Centre online or by telephone.

The payments appear in bank statements with the payment reference beginning with the customer’s National Insurance number followed by ‘DWP WFP’ for people in Great Britain, or ‘DFC WFP’ for people in Northern Ireland. Pensioners are being asked to double check their bank statements for this reference number before contacting DWP.

The overwhelming majority of Winter Fuel Payments are paid automatically but some people need to make a claim, such as those who qualify but do not receive benefits or the State Pension and have never previously received a Winter Fuel Payment.

Those who need to make a claim have until 31 March 2023 to do so, with further information on who needs to make a claim available on the GOV.UK Winter Fuel Payment page.

Winter Fuel Payments – boosted this year by an additional £300 per household Pensioner Cost of Living payment – are part of an extensive package helping people of all ages with the cost of heating their homes this winter.

This includes providing households with £400 towards their energy bills, with the Government’s Energy Price Guarantee saving the typical household another £900 on top of this.

In addition, millions of payments of up to £650 have already been made this year to low-income households on eligible means-tested benefits as part of the government’s cost of living support. This includes pensioners receiving Pension Credit.

The average Pension Credit award is worth over £3,500 a year and the online Pension Credit calculator is on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

Alongside this, households receiving certain benefits – including Pension Credit – could be eligible for extra money between now and the end of March 2023 thanks to DWP’s Cold Weather Payments.

These are an automatic bank top-up of £25, paid to eligible households when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, zero degrees C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to an eligible person’s postcode. Postcodes already triggered this Winter can be found on the GOV.UK Cold Weather Payments Checker.

Further cost of living support to be paid next year was recently announced by the Chancellor. Payments will include a further £300 for pensioner households, up to £900 for households on means-tested benefits and £150 for those on eligible disability benefits.

15/03/2023,"A revolution in childcare, a £27 billion tax cut for business and a trio of freezes to help families with the cost-of-living headlined the Chancellor’s Spring Budget today, Wednesday 15 March.","
    
          
Childcare revolution to expand 30 hours free childcare for children over the age of nine months, alongside boosts to subsidised childcare for parents on Universal Credit including upfront support.
  A £27 billion tax cut for business through radical ‘full expensing’ policy and capital allowances reform which will drive investment and growth.
  Measures to ease cost-of-living burden will help more than halve inflation, with extension of Energy Price Guarantee and duties on fuel and a pub pint both frozen.
  Major set of reforms to support people into work, removing barriers that stop those on benefits, older workers, and those with health conditions who want to work from working.
  Inflation falling, debt down and growth up in Chancellor’s Spring Budget for Growth that delivers upon the Prime Minister’s economic priorities.
Aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable economic growth that delivers prosperity for the people of the United Kingdom, the Spring Budget breaks down barriers to work, unshackles business investment and tackles labour shortages head on.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt said:

“Our plan is working – inflation falling, debt down and a growing economy.

“Britain is on a lasting path to growth with a revolution in childcare support, the biggest ever employment package and the best investment incentives in Europe.”

The Chancellor announced 30 hours of free childcare for every child over the age of 9 months, with support being phased in until every single eligible working parent of under 5s gets this support by September 2025.

The government will also pay the childcare costs of parents on Universal Credit moving into work or increasing their hours upfront, rather than in arrears – removing a major barrier to work for those who are on benefits. The maximum they can claim will also be boosted to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children – an increase of around 50%.

The Chancellor went on to set out plans to continue to support households with cost-of-living pressures including keeping the Energy Price Guarantee at £2,500 for the next three months and ending the premium that over 4 million households pay on their prepayment meter, bringing their charges into line with comparable customers who pay by direct debit. Taken together with all the government’s efforts to help households with higher costs, these measures bring the total support to an average of £3,300 per UK household over 2022-23 and 2023-24.

To help household budgets further, the planned 11 pence rise in fuel duty will be cancelled, maintaining last year’s 5p cut for another twelve months,    saving a typical driver another £100 on top of the £100 saved so far since last year’s cut.

The generosity of Draught Relief has also been significantly extended from 5% to 9.2%, so that the duty on an average draught pint of beer served in a pub both does not increase from August and will be up to 11 pence lower than the duty in supermarkets. The commitment to duty on a pub pint being lower than the supermarket has been termed the “Brexit Pubs Guarantee” by the Chancellor, and this change will also be enjoyed by every pub in Northern Ireland thanks to the Windsor Framework.

The Chancellor also set out a comprehensive plan to remove the barriers to work facing those on benefits, those with health conditions and older workers. An increase in the pensions Annual Allowance from £40,000 to £60,000 and the abolition of the Lifetime Allowance will remove the disincentives to working for longer. A new ‘Returnerships’ skills offer for older workers and more stringent Universal Credit job search requirements also feature in the plan that will boost the UK’s workforce, fill vacancies and support economic growth.

In line with the government’s vision for the UK to be the best place in Europe for companies to locate, invest and grow, a new policy of ‘full expensing’ will be introduced for the next three years to boost business investment in an effective cut to corporation tax of £9 billion per year. This makes the UK the joint most competitive capital allowances regime in the OECD and the only major European economy to have such a policy. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that this will increase business investment by 3% for every year it is in place. Mr Hunt signalled an intention to make this scheme – which covers equipment for factories, computers and other machinery - permanent when responsible to do so.

Accompanying forecasts by the OBR confirm that with the package of measures Mr Hunt set out today, the economy is on track to grow with inflation halved this year and debt falling – meeting all of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s economic priorities. This comes alongside the confirmation that there are no new tax rises within the Spring Budget.

Childcare

Significant reforms to childcare will remove barriers to work for nearly half a million parents with a child under 3 in England not working due to caring responsibilities, reducing discrimination against women and benefitting the wider economy in the process.

30 hours of free childcare for every child over the age of 9 months with working parents by September 2025, where eligibility will match the existing 3-4 year-old 30 hours offer.
  This will be introduced in phases, with 15 hours of free childcare for working parents of 2-year-olds coming into effect in April 2024 and 15 hours of free childcare for working parents of 9 months – 3 years old in September 2024.
  The funding paid to nurseries for the existing free hours offers will also be increased by £204 million from this September rising to £288 million next year.
  Schools and local authorities will be funded to increase the supply of wraparound care, so that parents of school age children can drop their children off between 8am and 6pm – tackling the barriers to working caused by limited availability of wraparound care.
  Childcare costs of parents moving into work or increasing their hours on Universal Credit paid upfront rather than in arrears, with maximum claim boosted to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children – an increase of around 50%.
  In recognition of both the importance and short supply of childminders, incentive payments of £600 will be piloted from Autumn of this year for those who sign up to the profession (rising to £1,200 for those who join through an agency) to increase the number available and increase choice and affordability for parents.
Employment

The Chancellor set out a comprehensive plan to help people move into work, increase their hours, and extend their working lives, including for those on benefits.

The Lifetime Allowance charge will be removed before being abolished altogether, removing barriers to remaining in work and simplifying the tax system by taking thousands out of the complexity of pension tax.
  The Annual Allowance will be increased from £40,000 to £60,000, incentivising highly-skilled workers to remain in the labour market. As a result of the pensions tax measures announced today, an estimated 80% of NHS doctors will not receive a tax charge with respect to accruals under the 2015 NHS career average scheme.
  A new ‘Returnerships’ apprenticeship targeted at the over 50s will refine existing skills programmes to make them more accessible to older workers, giving them the skills and support they need to find a recognisable path back into work.
  The midlife MOT offer will be expanded and improved to ensure people get the best possible financial, health and career guidance well ahead of retirement. There will be an enhanced digital midlife MOT tool and an expansion of DWP’s in person midlife MOTs for 50+ Universal Credit claimants, aiming to reach 40,000 per year.
  A DWP White Paper on disability benefits reform will herald the biggest change to the welfare system in the past ten years, to make sure it better meets the needs of disabled people in Great Britain. This includes removing the Work Capability Assessment, meaning the majority of claimants will now have to do one health assessment rather than two. Reforms will also support claimants to try work without fear of losing their financial support.
  A new voluntary employment scheme for disabled people and those with health conditions called Universal Support will be funded in England and Wales. The government will spend up to £4,000 per person to find them a suitable role and cater to their needs, supporting 50,000 places per year once fully rolled out.
  A £406 million plan to tackle the leading health causes keeping people out of work, with investment targeted at services for mental health, musculoskeletal conditions, and cardiovascular disease.
  Strengthening work search and work preparation requirements for around 700,000 lead carers of children aged 1-12 claiming Universal Credit in Great Britain.
  Increasing the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET) - which determines how much support and Work Coach time a claimant will receive based on their earnings - for an individual claimant, from the equivalent of 15 to 18 hours at National Living Wage and removing the couples AET in Great Britain. Over 100,000 non-working or low-earning individuals will be asked to meet more regularly with their Work Coach for support to move into work or increase their earnings.
  The application and enforcement of the Universal Credit sanctions regime will be strengthened, by providing additional training for Work Coaches to apply sanctions effectively, including for claimants who do not look for or take up employment, and automating administrative elements of the sanctions process to reduce error rates and free up Work Coach time.
  Elsewhere, international talent will be attracted through a new migration package that includes adding five construction occupations to the Shortage Occupation List and expanding the range of short-term business activities that are covered under the UK’s six-month business visit visa offer.
Enterprise

The Chancellor put forward a plan to boost innovation, drive business investment and hold down energy costs.

A ‘full expensing’ policy introduced from 1 April 2023 until 31 March 2026 and an extension to the 50% first-year allowance in the same period – a transformation in capital allowances worth £27 billion to businesses over three years.
  A £500 million per year package of support for 20,000 research and development (R&D) intensive businesses through changes to R&D tax credits.
  Generous reforms to tax reliefs for the creative sectors will ensure theatres, orchestras, museums and galleries are protected against ongoing economic pressures and even more world-class productions are made in the UK.
  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will receive £10 million extra funding over two years to maximise its use of Brexit freedoms and accelerate patient access to treatments. This will allow, from 2024, the MHRA to introduce new, swift approvals systems, speeding up access to treatments already approved by trusted international partners and ground-breaking technologies such as cancer vaccines and AI therapeutics for mental health.
  All of the recommendations from Sir Patrick Vallance’s review into pro-innovation regulation of digital technologies, published alongside Spring Budget today, are to be accepted.
  £900 million of funding for an AI Research Resource and an exascale computer – making the UK one of only a handful of countries to have one – and a commitment to £2.5 billion ten-year quantum research and innovation programme through the government’s new Quantum Strategy.
Levelling Up

To level up growth across the UK and spread opportunity everywhere, local communities will be empowered to command their economic destiny.

Greater responsibility for local leaders to grow their local economy.
  Over £200 million for high quality local regeneration projects in areas of need, from the transformation of Ashington Town Centre to a skills and education campus in Blackburn.
  Over £400 million for new Levelling Up Partnerships for twenty areas in England most in need of levelling up, such as Rochdale and Mansfield.
  Business rates retention expanded to more areas in the next Parliament.
  Delivering trailblazer devolution deals for the West Midlands and Greater Manchester Combined Authorities that include single multi-year settlements for the next Spending Review, alongside a commitment to negotiate further devolution deals in England.
  12 Investment Zones across the UK including 4 across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
  £8.8 billion over the next five-year funding period for a second round of the City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements.
Many of today’s decisions on tax and spending apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As a result of decisions that do not apply UK-wide, the Scottish Government will receive around an additional £320 million over 2023-24 and 2024-25, the Welsh Government will receive £180 million, and the Northern Ireland Executive will receive £130 million.

15/03/2023,"Millions of households will get more support with high energy bills to help ease the cost of living, the Chancellor has announced today ahead of the Spring Budget. ","
    
          

    The Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) will be kept at £2,500 for an additional three months from April to June, saving a typical household £160.
  
  
    Energy prices are 50% lower than forecast in October, but remain high, with this support helping bridge the gap to lower prices forecast from the end of June.
  
  
    Comes as Chancellor set to confirm new cost of living support at Spring Budget, including ending the prepayment meter premium and help with childcare costs.
  
The Energy Price Guarantee, which is protecting households by capping typical energy bills at £2,500, will be maintained at the same level for a further three months over April, May, and June, worth £160 in total for a typical household.

The Chancellor is announcing the extension today (15 March) as part of his Spring Budget, which focuses on easing the impact of rising prices, delivering on our promise to halve inflation, and growing the economy by supporting more people into work.

Government support has already cut the typical family energy bill by over £1,300 since October, stopping the average household energy bill hitting £4,279 a year this winter.

The Chancellor’s three-month extension of the Energy Price Guarantee at £2,500 means households won’t feel the full force of Ofgem’s Price Cap between April and June – which stands at £3,280 – helping to bridge consumers into the summer.

Lower wholesale gas prices are expected to feed through to lower household energy bills from July, where Cornwall Insight data suggests the Ofgem Price Cap will reach an estimated £2,100 a year for a typical household.

From April, more support is coming online with 8 million low income and vulnerable households set to receive at least £900 in cash payments over the next year, benefits and pensions set to rise by over 10 per cent, and the National Living Wage increasing to a record £10.42 an hour, so that it always pays to work.

The Spring Budget will go even further, providing hundreds of pounds more in help with childcare costs for parents on Universal Credit and ending the energy premium paid by households who use prepayment meters, which will save 4 million families £45 a year from July.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said:


  We know people are worried about their bills rising in April, so to give people some peace of mind, we’re keeping the Energy Price Guarantee at its current level until the summer when gas prices are expected to fall.

  Continuing to hold down energy bills is part of our plan to help hardworking families with the cost of living and halve inflation this year.


Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said:


  High energy bills are one of the biggest worries for families, which is why we’re maintaining the Energy Price Guarantee at its current level. With energy bills set to fall from July onwards, this temporary change will bridge the gap and ease the pressure on families, while also helping to lower inflation too.


Energy Secretary, Grant Shapps said:


  Putin’s illegal war has cost British families, which is why we’ve stepped in to pay around half of the typical household energy bill.

  With wholesale prices falling families will start to benefit, but in the meantime we’re stepping back in with the Energy Price Guarantee to prevent the typical electricity and gas bill exceeding £2,500. It’s just part of our plan to help families this winter.


At Autumn Statement the Chancellor announced that the EPG was due to rise to £3,000 on April 1, with the Government then expecting to borrow £12 billion to fund this support. Since then, energy prices have fallen by 50%, cutting the borrowing needed to fund energy support by two- thirds to £4 billion.

The change announced today also follows the latest Ofgem Price cap of £3,280 from April to June which, in large part, sets the cost for this three-month extension. Households would pay the full Ofgem price cap rate if there was no Energy Price Guarantee.

Holding down energy bills is also part of the government’s plan to halve inflation this year, and in November the Office for Budget Responsibility said that the EPG would lower the peak rate of inflation.
"
03/10/2022,Over 8 million households are set to receive an additional £324 as part of the government’s Cost of Living support package.,"
    
          The £324 Cost of Living Payment, which follows on from a £326 payment made from July, is part of £1,200 support package for millions this year
  The £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment was provided in September, with a £300 additional pensioner payment to come in the Winter
Millions of households across the UK will receive a £324 cost of living cash boost by the 23 of November.

The government has today announced that households receiving DWP benefits will receive the second part of the £650 Cost of Living Payment from 8 November and continuing through to the 23 November.

Over 8  million families have already received the first Cost of Living Payment, worth £326, which was sent out from 14 July this year.

The second payment will automatically be paid into the bank accounts of those eligible in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who receive a qualifying benefit, meaning they will not need to do anything to receive the money.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Chloe Smith said:


  Millions of families will soon see a £324 cash boost as part of our extensive £1,200 support package, helping to raise incomes and manage the rising cost of living.

  We understand that people are struggling which is why and we’re committed to supporting the most vulnerable households. That’s also why we are focused on driving growth and delivering quality public services so we can continue to support those in need through these challenging times while boosting opportunity for all.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng added:


  We know that people have been worried about their bills ahead of this winter, which is why we’ve taken decisive action to hold down energy bills, saving the average household around £1,000 a year, and provided £1,200 of targeted support to the most vulnerable.

  Without our intervention, analysts were predicting that the average annual energy bill could have reached £6,500 next year. We were never going to let this happen.

  Our Growth Plan will also leave more money in people’s pockets and, over the longer term, help drive economic growth – the only way to permanently boost everyone’s living standards.


The DWP will pay a small number of payments on the 8 November, with numbers increasing significantly from the 9 November. Even if you are not on a qualifying DWP benefit you may still be eligible for the £324 payment as HMRC are also making payments to those who receive tax credits and no other eligible benefits. These will be paid shortly after DWP payments and customers do not need to contact the government or apply for the payment at any stage.

This payment comes on top of extensive government support with the cost of living this winter, including around 6 million disabled people having been paid a separate £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment, whilst over 8 million pensioner households will receive an extra one-off £300 Winter Fuel Payment this year. This is in addition to an extension to the Household Support Fund, which is providing an extra £421 million for use between October and March to help vulnerable people with the essentials.

As well as this, a £150 Council Tax rebate was sent earlier this year to those in Council Tax bands  A to D in England, creating a total of at least £1,200 in direct support for millions. A £400 reduction on energy bills is also being given to all domestic electricity customers over the coming months, and a new ‘Energy Price Guarantee’, which means from 1 October the average UK household will save at least £1,000 a year based on current energy prices.
"
30/09/2022,As of today (30 September) the Department for Work and Pensions has processed almost six million £150 Disability Cost of Living payments worth around £900 million.,"
    
          This follows the government’s announcement on 20 September that those who had confirmed payment of their disability benefit for 25 May will receive the £150 automatically, with the vast majority to be paid by early October.

The vast majority of eligible claimants who were due to receive the one-off £150 payment from the DWP by early October have now had their payment processed.

The payment will help disabled people with the rising cost of living, acknowledging the higher costs they often face, such as for care and mobility needs.

There will be some cases – such as those who gained entitlement to this payment at a later date or where payments were rejected due to invalid account details – who will not be paid by the beginning of October. These will be paid automatically as soon as possible.

The £150 cost of living payments for disabled people from the government are part of a £37 billion package of support, which will see millions of low income households receive at least £1,200 this year to help cover rising costs.

This also follows the Prime Minister’s announcement of a new Energy Price Guarantee for the next two winters, saving households on average £1,000 a year on their energy bills.
"
22/06/2022,Over 8 million households in the UK will get a cash payment from July 2022 to ease cost of living pressures.,"
    
          Over 8 million households will receive the first of two cost of living instalments totalling £650 from 14 July 2022, part of the £1,200 support package this year
  Initial automatic instalment for means-tested benefit claimants will be £326, with the rest to follow in a second instalment from the autumn
  Tax credit claimants will also receive their first instalment of the cost of living payment from HMRC later this year
  Comes as part of £37 billion government package to help families with cost of living pressures
After ministers confirmed initial payments would begin from 14 July 2022, the Department for Work and Pensions has now revealed how many people in each part of the country will receive the new financial support. They have also revealed that the disability top-up will land in bank accounts in September 2022.

These figures show that nearly one in four families will receive the means-tested benefit cost of living payment, whilst nearly one in ten of the population will get the £150 disability top-up.

The first cost of living instalment will see millions of low-income households in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland initially £326 better off as the government delivers significant interventions to support groups who are most vulnerable to rising costs. In total, millions of households will receive at least £1,200 from the government this year to help cover rising costs.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey said:


  With millions of the lowest-income households soon seeing the first of two cash instalments land into their bank accounts, we are taking action to directly help families with the cost of living.



  This one-off payment totalling £650 is part of our £37 billion cost of living support package that will put an extra £1,200 into the pockets of those most in need.


The second instalment of £324 will be sent to qualifying low income households from the Autumn. The payments are designed to be deliberately slightly unequal to minimise fraud risks from those who may seek to exploit this system.

The eligibility date for the second instalment will be announced soon. If customers are eligible through receiving tax credits only, HMRC will contact them and issue payments automatically, with the first instalment being made from autumn. DWP will administer payments for customers on all other eligible means-tested benefits, and customers do not need to contact them or apply for the payment.

Low-income households are benefiting from government support in a variety of different ways this year as global inflationary pressures, exacerbated by the unjust war in Ukraine, have caused prices to rise for several essentials. The government understands that many people are worried about the impact these rising prices will have on their household finances, which is why £37 billion of support is being provided to boost budgets and mitigate the worst of these pressures.

Support includes the direct cost of living payment of up to £650 for over 8 million households on eligible means-tested benefits, a separate £300 payment for pensioners, and a £150 payment for eligible disabled people, which can be paid on top of the £650 payment.

This is on top of £400 for all households to help with energy bills, and an extra £150 for properties in Council Tax bands A-D, meaning millions of the lowest-income households will receive at least £1,200 in support this year. This is all in addition to changes to the Universal Credit taper rate and work allowances worth £1,000 a year on average for 1.7 million working claimants, a rise in the National Living Wage to £9.50 an hour, and a tax cut for around 30 million workers through a rise in National Insurance contribution thresholds.

The government has also expanded support for the Household Support Fund – which helps people with food and energy bills – with an extra £421 million, on top of £79 million for devolved nations; the total value of this support now stands at £1.5 billion. Fuel duty was also cut by 5p per litre for 12 months in March, and alcohol duty has been frozen for 2022/23.

The second instalment of £324 will be sent to qualifying low income households in the Autumn. The payments are designed to be deliberately slightly unequal to minimise fraud risks from those who may seek to exploit this system.

The eligibility date for the second instalment will be announced soon.

Low-income households are benefiting from government support in a variety of different ways this year as global inflationary pressures, exacerbated by the unjust war in Ukraine, have caused prices to rise for several essentials. The government understands that many people are worried about the impact these rising prices will have on their household finances, which is why £37 billion of support is being provided to boost budgets and mitigate the worst of these pressures.

Support includes the direct payment of £650 for over 8 million households on benefits, a separate £300 payment for pensioners, and a £150 payment for disabled people, which can be paid on top of the £650 payment.

This is on top of £400 for all households to help with energy bills, and an extra £150 for properties in Council Tax bands A-D, meaning millions of the lowest-income households will receive at least £1,200 in support this year. This is all in addition to changes to the Universal Credit taper rate and work allowances worth £1,000 a year on average for 1.7 million working claimants, a rise in the National Living Wage to £9.50 an hour, and a tax cut for around 30 million workers through a rise in National Insurance contribution thresholds.

The government has also expanded support for the Household Support Fund – which helps people with food and energy bills – with an extra £421 million, on top of £79 million for devolved nations; the total value of this support now stands at £1.5 billion. Fuel duty was also cut by 5p per litre for 12 months in March 2022, and alcohol duty has been frozen for 2022/23.

          Household Support Fund doubled to £1 billion with £500 million of new funding, as government goes further to support families with cost of living
  Six-month extension will help most vulnerable households deal with rising cost of essentials
  People can continue to access support through their Local Authority, ensuring those most in need get the help available
Today’s bolstered fund will continue to target the most vulnerable households and individuals, having helped thousands of families since its launch in September.

A third of the funding will be ring-fenced to support families with children, while another third will be dedicated to pensioners. This ensures the people who need it most will continue to receive vital support to meet essential household costs.

Using their local knowledge, Local Authorities will determine how to best use the remainder of the fund within the scope set out by ministers. Previous funding has supported households with food, clothing, energy and water costs, and this extension will ensure that this support continues through to the autumn.

Thérèse Coffey, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said:


  We have always provided help to those who need it and extending this fund is another commitment to support people with the cost of living.



  We know the pressures many are currently facing, especially pensioners and families with children, which is why this fund targets support to the most vulnerable households across the country.


Of the £500 million, the devolved administrations will receive £79 million through the Barnett formula. This brings the total Household Support Fund allocations for the devolved administrations to £82 million for the Scottish Government, £50 million for the Welsh Government and £28 million for the Northern Ireland Executive. It will be for the devolved administrations to decide how to allocate this additional funding.

This fund is part of £22 billion of support provided in 2022-23 to help families with the cost of living and to ensure people keep more of their money. This includes changes to the Universal Credit taper rate and work allowances worth £1,000 extra on average for working families, and an increase in National Insurance thresholds. It also includes help for energy costs through a cut to fuel duty and the £9.1 billion Energy Rebate. And from tomorrow (1 April 2022), the National Living Wage will be rising to £9.50 an hour, providing a timely boost to the lowest paid.

If you want to find out what help is available in your area through the Household Support Fund, contact your local council. You can locate your council using the GOV.UK council finder.

22/07/2022,Over 7.2 million payments of £326 have already been made to help households through the government’s Cost of Living support.,"
    
          7.2 million payments of £326 – worth a total of £2.4 billion – made in first week of Cost of Living support rollout
  Payments mark the first half of the £650 Cost of Living payment for low-income families, with the second half coming in the autumn
  Additional support for disabled people and pensioners will follow later this year
This means £2.4 billion has been paid out to low-income families in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with the second instalment of £324 arriving later this year.

The first payments were made on 14 July 2022, meaning the government has paid on average over a million families every working day since then.

This is all part of the government’s £37 billion support package for households. Millions will get £1,200 this year to help them with rising costs, including this £650 payment, a £400 grant to help with energy bills, and a £150 Council Tax rebate for the 80% of households in bands A-D.

And in addition to this, nearly 1 in 10 people will get a £150 disability payment this autumn, while over eight million pensioner households could receive an extra £300 through their Winter Fuel Payments in November and December.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey said:


  This government said that we would protect those on the lowest incomes, and we have delivered what we said with over 7 million households receiving £326 in the last week. There is more help to come for households, with the second half of the £650 payment arriving later this year and further payments for pensioners and disabled people also on the way.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nadhim Zahawi said:


  I know that people are finding things difficult with rising prices and increasing pressure on household budgets.

  That’s why we’re taking action to control inflation and providing immediate help for households. It’s so important that over 7 million vulnerable households have received £326 direct payments so far and there is also more help to come, with 8 million of the most vulnerable households receiving £1,200 of direct support to help with bills over the winter.


In total, over eight million families will be eligible for this payment, with around one million eligible because they receive tax credits and no other eligible benefits. These families will receive their first instalment from HMRC in the autumn, and the second instalment in the winter.

DWP will administer payments for customers on all other eligible means-tested benefits, and no one needs to contact the government or apply for the payment at any stage.

Those who are eligible should look out in their bank accounts for a payment of £326 with the reference “DWP Cost of Living” in their bank accounts. This payment is made automatically, meaning no one has to apply or do anything to receive it.

Eligible claimants who have not received their payment yet should not be concerned, as the DWP expects some payments may take until 31 July 2022 to come through.
"
14/07/2022,"Almost one in four families across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will get £326 sent directly to them from today, with the second instalment of £324 sent later this year as part of the government’s £37 billion support package.","
    
          £326 – the first of two cost of living payments – will automatically hit seven million bank accounts between today and 31 July 2022 as part of the government’s £37 billion support package
  Second instalment of £324 will follow from the autumn, with separate payments for pensioners and disabled people also coming later this year
  Tax credit claimants will receive their first cost of living instalment by autumn
Over eight million households on means-tested benefits will automatically get the first instalment of £326 from this month.

This means that, combined with other support, millions of low-income households across the UK will receive at least £1,200 from the government by Christmas to ease Cost of Living pressures.

On top of that, nearly one in ten people will get the £150 disability payment this Autumn, and over 8 million pensioner households could get an extra £300 from Winter Fuel Payments in November and December.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:


  Just as we looked after people during lockdown, we will help them get through these tough economic times.

  Today’s payment is the signal to millions of families that we are on their side and we have already promised more cash in the autumn, alongside other measures – including our Help for Households – to support the vulnerable and ease the burden.


Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey said:


  Our help for households will begin landing in bank accounts today as we make sure those on the lowest incomes get the support they need in the face of rising costs.

  This first instalment of £326 should reach all eligible low-income households by the end of July.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nadhim Zahawi said:


  It’s great that millions of the families who are most in need are starting to receive their Cost of Living Payments, which I know will be a massive help for people who are struggling.

  Alongside tax cuts, changes to Universal Credit and the Household Support Fund, these payments are a vital part of our £37 billion support package to help people deal with rising prices.


Most people entitled to the first instalment of our Cost of Living payment will receive it between now and 31 July 2022. Households who are eligible because they receive tax credits and no other eligible benefits will receive their first instalment from HMRC in the autumn, and the second instalment in the winter. DWP will administer payments for customers on all other eligible means-tested benefits, and customers do not need to contact the government or apply for the payment at any stage.

In addition to the £650 Cost of Living Payment, all domestic energy customers in the UK will receive a £400 grant to help with energy bills, and those in Council Tax bands A-D in England will get an extra £150, which has already been sent to many households. This brings support for millions to £1,200 by the end of the year.

The disability and pensioner payments come in addition to this, as does any support from the Household Support Fund, which was recently extended through to March 2023 with £421 million additional funding. It is now worth £1.263 billion, and combined with £237 million for devolved nations, means this support package now stands at £1.5 billion. The Household Support Fund is designed to help low-income households in England with food and energy bills, and is distributed by local authorities, who know their areas best.

Total government support this year for low-income families stands at £37 billion, a figure which includes a recent rise to £12,570 for the National Insurance starting thresholds. This will benefit 30 million working people and is worth £330 to a typical employee.
"
15/06/2022,Pensioners and their loved ones are being urged to take up Pension Credit as new figures show an estimated £1.7 billion in benefit is being left unclaimed.,"
    
          Currently, over 1.4 million pensioners in Britain receive Pension Credit. However, many are still not claiming this extra financial help that can be worth over £3,300 a year.

It comes as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) today held its second annual Pension Credit Day of Action as part of a new advertising campaign.

DWP will also be providing leaflets for local communities, while businesses can also get involved in the campaign by spreading the word to their customers using the department’s digital toolkit and encouraging them to call the claim line between the hours of 8am to 6pm.

All State Pension recipients will continue to receive reminders about Pension Credit in the post as part of the department’s annual uprating communications.

Minister for Pensions Guy Opperman said: 


  We recognise the challenges some pensioners will be facing with the cost of living which is why promoting Pension Credit is a priority.

  We’re calling on everyone with retired family, friends and loved ones to check in with them and see if they can get this extra financial support, which could make a huge difference to people’s everyday lives.


Martin Lewis, founder and chair of MoneySavingExpert.com, said:


  Amidst the cost of living crisis, it’s a national tragedy that getting on for a million pensioners are missing out on a major income boost. My simple rule of thumb is if you (or someone you know) are aged 66 or older, and have total income of under roughly £200 a week, get online or call the Pension Credit claim line to see if you’re due a payment that can be as much as £3,300 a year. I’m not saying everyone will get it, but many will, and it only takes a few minutes to find out. So don’t stall, just call.

  And not only is this serious money, it’s also often a gateway entitlement that means you’re due a range of other support, such as council tax reductions, the £650 extra energy funding help, warm home discount, housing benefit, dental and optical treatments and, for the over-75s, a free TV licence. So again, don’t stall, just call!


Rich Mackenzie, DWP Visiting Officer, said:


  Many people who could claim Pension Credit aren’t.

  I would appeal to anyone who comes into contact with pensioners to ask how much they know about Pension Credit. It could be something that helps, and in the current financial climate, there’s no doubt that more people will experience hardship.

  Pension Credit won’t solve every problem, but it will go a long way to alleviating difficulties. It should be a collective endeavour for us all.



Dame Clare Moriarty, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice, said:


  At a time when millions of people are struggling with the rising cost of living, it’s more important than ever that people are getting the support they’re entitled to.

  Pension Credit can be a really important boost for older people who are struggling with a low income. Citizens Advice can help you to understand if you might be eligible and advise you on how to make a claim.


The campaign also includes tackling some of the myths that may stop people applying, such as how having savings, a pension or owning a home are not necessarily barriers to receiving Pension Credit.

It also reminds people that even a small award can provide access to a wide range of other benefits – such as help with housing costs, council tax or heating bills. For those over 75, this includes continued entitlement to a free TV licence.

Pension Credit can be claimed by phone and online, ensuring that older people can apply safely and easily, wherever they are. The online Pension Credit calculator is also on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

Pension Credit is designed to help with daily living costs for people over State Pension age and on a low income, though you do not need to be in receipt of State Pension to receive it.

It tops up a person’s income to a minimum of £182.60 per week for single pensioners and to £278.70 for couples.

15/08/2022,A survey of thousands of individuals and small businesses shows how well banks are looking after their customers as people face the rising cost of living.,"
    
          The latest independent results from large scale surveys ranking the service quality of personal and business current account providers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are available via the links below:


Ipsos (which covers personal current accounts)
  
BVA BDRC (which covers business current accounts)
Following its investigation into the retail banking sector, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) made it compulsory for all relevant banks to take part in these surveys, so customers get the full picture. Account providers must display their ranking prominently both in branch and on their websites and apps.

Personal and small business current account holders were asked how likely they would be to recommend their provider to a friend, relative or other business. The survey also covered the quality of online and mobile provision, branch and overdraft services and, for small businesses, the quality of the relationship management they receive.

The results show customers how their bank is ranked on overall quality of service and make it easier for people to compare offers. They also promote competition between providers, resulting in better experiences for all account holders.

Overall, the top-ranked business current account providers in Northern Ireland are Santander and Danske Bank while the bottom-ranked business current account providers are Bank of Ireland UK and AIB.

Adam Land, Senior Director at the CMA, said:


  As the rising cost of living bites, it’s important that people and businesses have the information they need to manage their money and make savings.

  These results show how banks are treating their customers at a time when many are feeling the pinch.

  When times are tough you find out who’s fighting your corner and if your bank doesn’t match up to the competition – you can vote with your feet and make a switch.


If you’ve found another bank that could give you a better deal, the Current Account Switch Service helps to make the process of switching much simpler. This free service is available to anyone with a personal or business current account in the UK.

Check the list of participating banks and building societies to make sure you can use the Current Account Switch Service.

The survey was established as part of the Retail Banking Order - a set of reforms established by the CMA following its retail banking market investigation in 2016.

The CMA enforces the Retail Banking Order, and regularly checks that banks are doing what they’re required to do. If the CMA finds the Order is being breached, it can take action. Learn more about what happens when banks breach the Order.

11/05/2022,"The CMA’s most senior enforcer has warned that anyone looking to exploit the cost-of-living crisis by forming cartels risk robust enforcement action, including possible dawn raids.","
    
          In a speech today Michael Grenfell, Executive Director of enforcement at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said the cost-of-living crisis would have a ‘huge impact’ on consumers but that competition was key to minimising that impact.  

He added that:


  We will tackle anti-competitive practices and transactions that unnecessarily raise prices. We will not allow cartelists to treat the current economic circumstances as an excuse for anti-competitive collusion that makes things worse for consumers. The dawn raids we have launched already this year should serve as a signal of our intent.


He also said that the CMA will continue to crack down on unfair practices such as subscription traps ‘that make things worse’.


  We have already used our consumer protection law powers to address the practice of subscription traps – the way suppliers make it harder for consumers who have signed up to a subscription subsequently to be free of it, especially as prices rise – and have secured improvements in the terms and conditions for subscriptions to anti-virus software and to online video games.

"
26/05/2022,Statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Cost of Living Support.,"
    
          
Madam Deputy Speaker,

The high inflation we are experiencing now is causing acute distress for the people of this country.

I know they are worried, I know people are struggling.

I want to explain what is happening, why it is happening, and what we propose to do about it.

I trust the British people, and I know they understand no government can solve every problem, particularly the complex and global challenge of inflation.

But this government will never stop trying to help people, to fix problems where we can, to do what is right – as we did throughout the pandemic.

We need to make sure that for those whom the struggle is too hard…and for whom the risks are too great…they are supported.

This government will not sit idly by whilst there is a risk that some in our country might be set so far back… they might never recover.

This is simply unacceptable. I will never allow that happen.

And I want to reassure everybody – we will get through this.

We have the tools and the determination we need to combat and reduce inflation.

We will make sure the most vulnerable and the least well off get the support they need at this time of difficulty.

And we will turn this moment of difficulty into a springboard for economic renewal and growth.

With more jobs, higher skills, greater investment - our plan for a stronger economy.

Madam Deputy Speaker,

Before I turn to the details of our plan, let me put into context for the House, the challenge we face.

This country is now experiencing the highest rate of inflation we have seen for forty years.

The Bank of England expect inflation to average around 9% this year.

Our exposure to global shocks continues to explain most of the inflation above the 2% target.

Supply chain disruption as the world reopened from Covid…

…combined with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine…

…and potentially exacerbated by recent lockdowns in China…

…are all contributing to significant price increases for goods and energy.

However, over the course of this year, the situation has evolved and has become more serious.

There are areas of particular concern.

Even excluding energy and food, core inflation has become broader based and elevated.

Of the basket of goods and services we use to measure inflation, a record proportion are seeing above average price increases.

Also, we are acutely exposed to the European energy price shock and, like the US, we have a tight labour market.

Make no mistake – the lowest unemployment in almost 50 years, just months after averting a jobs crisis during the pandemic, is good news.

But combined with the shock to European energy prices, it does contribute to the UK’s relatively high rate of inflation.

And lastly, as the Bank have noted, longer-term inflation expectations have risen above their historical averages, by more than they are in the US and Europe.

We cannot and must not allow short term inflationary pressures to lead people to expect that high inflation will continue over the long term.

Because Madam Deputy Speaker

We can get inflation under control.

It is not some abstract force outside our grasp.

It may take time, but we have the tools we need and the resolve it will take to reduce inflation.

Madam Deputy Speaker,

We have three specific tools available to combat and reduce inflation – and we are using them all.

Independent monetary policy. Fiscal responsibility. And supply side activism.

First, our primary tool is a strong, independent monetary policy.

Since control of monetary policy was taken out of the hands of politicians 25 years ago, inflation has averaged precisely 2%.

It is right the Bank of England are independent.

And I know the Governor and his team will take decisive action to get inflation back on target and ensure inflation expectations remain firmly anchored.

Second, we need responsible fiscal policy.

That means providing fiscal support where required but not making the situation unnecessarily worse…causing inflation, interest, and mortgage rates to go up further than they otherwise would.

Excessively adding fiscal stimulus into a supply constrained economy…

…especially one in which households and businesses have built up over £300 billion of excess savings…

…risks being counterproductive and increasing inflationary pressures.

In other words, fiscal support should be timely, targeted, and temporary.

Timely, because we need to help people when the shock is at its worst.

Targeted, because unconstrained stimulus will make the problem worse.

And temporary, because if we do not meet our fiscal rules, and ensure the public finances are resilient in the longer run…

…we create even greater risks on inflation, interest rates, and the trend rate of economic growth.

And third, we are taking an activist approach to supply side reforms.

This will increase our productive capacity, ease inflationary pressures, and raise our long-term growth potential.

The PM’s energy security strategy will, over time, reduce bills by increasing energy supply and improving energy efficiency.

The W&P Secretary is moving half a million jobseekers off welfare and into work…

…and doing more to support older people back into the jobs market.

The Home Secretary is making our visa regime for high-skilled migrants one of the most competitive in the world.

And, in the autumn, we will bring forward tax cuts and reforms to encourage businesses to invest more, train more, and innovate more – the path to higher growth.

So, independent monetary policy.

Fiscal responsibility.

Supply side reform.

The country should have confidence, that using these three tools…

…we will combat inflation – and reduce it over time.

But of course, we know that households are being hit hard, right now.

So today, Madam Deputy Speaker, we will provide significant support to the British people.

But as I have said, a critical part of how we are dealing with inflation is responsible fiscal policy.

What this means in practical terms is that as we support people more, we need to think about the fairest way to fund as much of that cost as possible.

The oil and gas sector is making extraordinary profits.

Not as the result of recent changes to risk taking or innovation or efficiency.

But as the result of surging global commodity prices – driven in part by Russia’s war.

And for that reason, I am sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly.

But as ever, there is a sensible middle ground.

We should not be ideological about this…we should be pragmatic.

It is possible to both tax extraordinary profits fairly…and incentivise investment.

And so, like previous governments, including Conservative ones – we will introduce a temporary, targeted, Energy Profits Levy.

But, we have built into the new Levy a new Investment Allowance, similar to the super-deduction…

…that means companies will have a new and significant incentive to reinvest their profits.

The new Levy will be charged on profits of oil and gas companies at a rate of 25%.

It will be temporary, and when oil and gas prices return to historically more normal levels, the Levy will be phased out – and with a sunset clause written into the legislation.

And, crucially, with our new investment allowance, we are nearly doubling the overall investment relief for oil and gas companies.

This means that, for every £1 a company invests, they’ll get back 90 per cent in tax relief.

So the more a company invests, the less tax they will pay.

And we understand that certain parts of the electricity generation sector are also making extraordinary profits.

The reason for this is the way our market works.

The price electricity generators are paid is linked not to the costs they incur in providing that electricity…but rather to the price of natural gas – which is extraordinarily high right now.

Other countries like France, Italy, Spain and Greece have already taken measures to correct this.

As set out in the Energy Security Strategy, we are consulting with the power generation sector and investors…

…to drive forward energy market reforms and ensure that the price paid for electricity is more reflective of the costs of production.

Those reforms will take time to implement.

So, in the meantime, we are urgently evaluating the scale of these extraordinary profits…and the appropriate steps to take.

So, Madam Deputy Speaker,

Our Energy Profits Levy will encourage investment, not deter it.

It raises around £5bn revenue over the next year so that we can help families with the cost of living.

And it avoids having to increase our debt burden further.

Because there is nothing noble in burdening future generations with ever more debt to pay…

…because politicians of the day were too weak to make the tough decisions.

Madam Deputy Speaker,

I know the whole House will agree we have a responsibility to help those who…

…through no fault of their own…

…are paying the highest price for the inflation we face.

To help with the cost of living, we are going to provide significant, targeted support to millions of the most vulnerable people in our society:

Those on the lowest incomes, pensioners, and disabled people.

First, people on the lowest incomes.

Over eight million households already have incomes low enough for the state to be supporting their cost of living through the welfare system.

They could be temporarily unemployed and looking for work.

Unable to work because of long-term sickness or disability.

Or on low pay and using benefits to top up their wages.

Right now, they face incredibly difficult choices.

So, I can announce today we will send, directly to around eight million of the lowest income households, a one-off Cost of Living Payment of £650.

Support worth over £5bn to give vulnerable people certainty that we are standing by them at this challenging time.

DWP will make the payment in two lump sums - the first from July, the second in autumn, with payments from HMRC for those on Tax Credits, following shortly after.

There is no need for people to fill out complicated forms or bureaucracy – we will send the payment straight into their bank accounts.

Our policy will benefit over eight million households in receipt of means-tested benefits, from July.

Uprating, in that time frame, could only be done for those on Universal Credit.

And our policy will provide a larger average payment this year of £650.

Whereas uprating the same benefits by 9% would only be worth, on average, £530.

There are two further groups who will need targeted extra support.

Many pensioners are disproportionately impacted by higher energy costs.

They can’t always increase their incomes through work.

And, because they spend more time at home, and are more vulnerable, they often need to keep the heating on for longer.

And we estimate many people who are eligible for Pension Credit are not currently claiming it…

…which means there will be many vulnerable pensioners not receiving means-tested benefits.

So, I can announce today that, from the autumn, we will send over eight million pensioner households who receive the Winter Fuel Payment – an extra, one-off Pensioner Cost of Living Payment of £300.

Disabled people also face extra costs in their day-to-day lives – like having energy-intensive equipment around the home or workplace.

So, to help the 6 million people who receive non-means tested disability benefits, we will send them, from September…

…an extra, one-off Disability Cost of Living Payment, worth £150.

Many disabled people will also receive the payment of £650 I have already announced, taking their total cost of living payments to £800.

And I can reassure the House that next year, subject to the Secretary of State’s review, benefits will be uprated by this September’s CPI…

…which, on current forecasts, is likely to be significantly higher than the forecast inflation rate for next year.

Similarly, the triple lock will apply for the state pension.

Of course, we recognise the risk that, as with any policy, there may be small numbers of people who fall between the cracks.

For example, it is not possible right now for DWP or HMRC to identify people on Housing Benefit who are not also claiming other benefits.

So, to support them and others, we will extend the Household Support Fund, delivered by Local Authorities, by £500m from October.

This is a significant set of interventions to support the most vulnerable in our country.

We will legislate to deliver this support on the same terms in every part of the United Kingdom – including Northern Ireland.

And, taken together, our direct cash payments, will help one third of all UK households with the cost of living, support worth over £9bn.

So, Madam Deputy Speaker,

We are meeting our responsibility to provide the most help to those on the lowest incomes.

I believe that is fair and I’m confident the House would agree.

But there are many other families who do not require state support in normal times.

They are also facing challenging times.

Is it fair to leave them unsupported?

The answer must surely be no.

While it is impossible for any government to solve every problem, we can and will ease the burden as we help the entire country through the worst of this crisis.

So, we will provide more support with the rising cost of energy – and that support will be universal.

Earlier this year, we announced £9bn to help with the cost of energy.

Including a Council Tax rebate of £150 for tens of millions of households.

And we plan to provide all households with £200 off their energy bills from October, with the cost of that repaid over the following five years.

Since then, the outlook for energy prices has changed.

I’ve heard people’s concerns about the impact of these repayments on future bills.

So I have decided that those repayments will be cancelled.

So, for the avoidance of doubt, this support is unambiguously a grant.

And furthermore, I have decided that the £200 of support for household energy bills will be doubled to £400 for everyone.

We’re on the side of hard-working families, with £6bn of financial support.

So, Madam Deputy Speaker,

To summarise.

Our strategy is to combat and reduce inflation over time through independent monetary policy, fiscal responsibility, and supply side activism.

We are raising emergency funds to help millions of the most vulnerable families who are struggling right now.

And all households will benefit from universal support for energy bills of £400 – with not a penny to repay.

In total, the measures I’ve announced today provide support worth £15bn.

Combined with the plans we’ve already announced…that means we are supporting families with the cost of living to the tune of £37bn or 1.5% of GDP.

That’s higher or similar to countries like France, Germany, and Italy.

And I’m proud to say that around three quarters of the total support will go to vulnerable households.

As a result of the measures we’ve announced today, and the action we’ve already taken this year:

The vast majority of households will receive £550.

Pensioners will receive £850.

And almost all of the eight million most vulnerable households in the country will, in total, receive support of at least £1,200.

Let me put this into context.

The House will have noted the news from Ofgem earlier this week.

They currently expect the energy price cap to rise in October to £2,800.

That’s an average increase in people’s bills this year of just under £1,200.

The same amount our policies will provide for the most vulnerable this year.

I know there are other pressures.

I am not trying to claim we have solved the entire problem for everyone.

No government could.

But I hope that when people hear the significant steps we are taking…

…the millions we are helping…

…they will feel some of the burden eased, some of the pressures lifted.

And they will know, this Government is standing by them.

And Madam Deputy Speaker in conclusion,

Supporting people with the cost of living is only one part of our plan for a stronger economy…

…A plan that is creating more jobs…

…Cutting taxes for working people…

…Reducing our borrowing and debt…

…Driving businesses to invest and innovate more…

…unleashing a skills revolution…

…Seizing the benefits of Brexit…

…And levelling up growth in all parts of the United Kingdom.

The British people can trust this government because we have a plan for a stronger economy and I commend this Statement to the House.

08/07/2022,"People worried about the cost of living or their debt payment plans are being urged to speak with their trustees, insolvency practitioners, or a debt adviser.","
    
          
The government understands that people are worried about the impact of rising prices and its effect on household incomes.

The government’s MoneyHelper has lots of free information and resources to help you manage your money in uncertain times and how to keep up with essential bills and payments.

If you are worried about debt, speaking to a trained and experienced debt adviser about your situation could help you decide what to do.

And if you are concerned about missing a payment towards your Individual Voluntary Arrangement, Income Payments Agreement or Income Payments Order having early conversations is the best first step to resolving your money issues and avoiding missing payments.

Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVA)

If you are in an IVA, you can ask your supervisor to review your income and expenses to see if you are eligible for a reduction in payments or payment break.

You will be required to provide evidence of your income and expenditure to support a change to your contributions. This could include providing payslips, statement of benefits or utility bills.

Any amendments to your contributions into your IVAs would need to be agreed with your creditors.

Your supervisor has been provided with the latest guidance on adjustments to payments, via the IVA Standing Committee, and they will also be aware of alternative solutions to help you resolve your debt issues and can help you find further information where appropriate.

Income Payments Agreements and Income Payments Orders

If you have an Income Payments Agreement or Income Payments Order, you can ask for a review of your income and expenses to see if you are eligible for a reduction in payments, or payment break.

The spending guidelines have been updated for inflation in the current financial climate and if you feel you need a review, you should contact the organisation you make payments to.

07/03/2023,"New, more flexible system introduced to empower adults to upskill or retrain throughout their working lives.","
    
          
People across the country are set to benefit from a complete overhaul of student finance, helping them get flexible loan funding to train, retrain and upskill throughout their working lives.

The Lifelong Loan Entitlement (LLE) will empower more people to study in a way that works for them, opening up opportunities for those that might have never considered higher education. This could help them balance training or studies alongside other commitments such as childcare or financial commitments, which will revolutionise social mobility and plug skills gaps.

Under the world-leading plans published today, the Government has confirmed that from 2025, people will be able to access loans worth the equivalent of four years of post-18 education (£37,000 in today’s tuition fees) under the LLE and use them flexibly over their working lives to suit their circumstances – transforming the student finance system.

The loan can be used to pay for full or part time study, for a variety of courses – from degrees to Higher Technical Qualifications, and including modules. Like a flexi-travel card, it allows people to jump on and off their learning, as opposed to having a ticket with a single destination.

Students will be able to keep track of their studies and see how much funding they have left in a personal account, and access information about the courses and modules they can spend it on. This will be available online, and operate much like a bank account.

Maintenance loans will also be available for students studying many more technical and part-time courses, including modules of courses for the first time. This will set the system on a par with traditional full-time study and open up new study and training opportunities for people from all backgrounds.

People who have previously studied will also be able to access this student finance, based on student loans they’ve already taken out. And under the new system, returning students will be able to study at an equivalent or lower level than they previously studied – something that the current system does not allow. For example, thanks to the new rules, from 2025, someone who previously had taken out a student loan to study a history degree will now be entitled to finance for a Higher Technical Qualification in Software Development.

The overhaul will not only empower people to learn throughout their lives and offer greater opportunities for learning, but enable workers to retrain and upskill to meet the needs of the cutting-edge industries and high-paid jobs of the future.

Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said:


  I know first-hand the benefits of lifelong learning, having retrained and upskilled numerous
times in my journey from apprentice to Education Secretary.

  Lifelong learning is critical to career progression, helping to fill skills gaps and boost the
economy, which is why this overhaul to our student finance system is so important.

  The Lifelong Loan Entitlement will give people flexibility to study, train and upskill
throughout their working life, in recognition that careers aren’t linear. In doing so, it will
facilitate a complete culture shift in the way further and higher education is viewed and
who it is available to.


The LLE will replace the previous student finance system from the start of academic year 2025/26.

In the consultation response published today, the government confirmed:


    People up to age 60 will be entitled to the LLE, equivalent to £37,000 in today’s fees, including returning students who will have access to any remaining funding once previous student loans are taken into account. For instance, this means that people who studied a three-year degree will still be entitled to one year’s worth of funding, which could be used to fund another short course or module.
  
  
    To encourage as many people as possible to retrain or return to study later in life, the “Equivalent or Lower Qualification (ELQ) exception rule” will also be removed. Previously, people could not return to study at an equivalent or lower level of qualification than they had already received. Under the new system, anyone wishing to retrain or study at an equivalent or lower level will have finance available to do so. As technological advancement ushers in a new era of work, the LLE will ensure changing paths is as easy as possible, or support people to upskill in their current career.
  
  
    To put technical study on a par with academic routes, maintenance support will be expanded to be offered across all eligible technical and part-time courses the LLE will fund, and offered for new modules of courses too.
  
  
    To make student finance as simple as possible, and to increase the number of options available to people, Higher Technical Qualifications will also be funded through the new system. These are technical qualifications at level 4 and 5 (between A level and degree level) which provide essential skills needed for careers from software engineer, to nursing, to data analyst. Under the LLE personal account, HTQs will sit side by side with academic routes, transforming the way these qualifications are viewed.
  
  
    The LLE will provide funding for new modules of courses, which will be introduced in stages: first for Higher Technical Qualifications and some technical level 4 and 5 qualifications from launch in 2025, before expanding to further level 4, 5 and 6 qualifications from 2027. Modules must be part of a full course so they can be stacked towards full qualifications if people wish, with studying picked up and put down throughout people’s working lives as it suits them.
  
  
    Students who have completed modules will receive a standardised transcript, in order to facilitate the transfer of credits.
  
Vivienne Stern MBE, Chief Executive, Universities UK said:


  A more flexible approach to higher education funding is right for learners, right for
employers and right for providers. Universities UK welcomes the direction of travel set out
today and will be examining the detail over the coming days.

  The removal of ELQ requirements and the expansion of part-time maintenance support
should be celebrated and will help new and returning people access the courses they
need to thrive. If we get the communication out to learners right and keep the burden on
providers low, then the Lifelong Loan Entitlement has the potential to be truly
transformative.


Jane Hickie, Chief Executive Officer, Association of Employment and Learning Providers (AELP) said:


  AELP warmly welcomes the Department for Education’s response to the Lifelong Loan
Entitlement consultation. The measures set out in the response really do have the
potential to revolutionise the way in which adults access skills provision throughout their
lives.

  In particular, the development of lifelong learning accounts will help empower much
greater choice for adults deciding how and where to undertake their future training needs.
We are also pleased to see the introduction of maintenance support covering provision at
Level 4 for the first time – as this will help more adults with the costs of living while
retraining. Furthermore, the relaxation of the equivalent or lower qualification rules also
represents an important step forward. This will provide learners with extra flexibility that
has already been successfully used in apprenticeships to enable adults to develop
additional skills in a rapidly evolving, fast-paced economy.

  We look forward to supporting these vital changes as the Lifelong Learning (Higher
Education Fee Limits) Bill makes its way through parliament.


Edward Peck, Vice-Chancellor and President, Nottingham Trent University said:


  The Lifelong Loan Entitlement will transform the way in which every adult in England can
engage with higher education, including those who have never done so before. It will
redefine what it means to say you have been to university.

  This will benefit individuals, employers, and society as people enhance their skills and
productivity by studying courses in flexible ways that fit both their ambitions and their
circumstances. Universities now need to rise to the opportunity by delivering programmes
that enable leaners to make the most of this bold and innovative approach to funding fees
and maintenance.


David Hughes, Chief Executive of Association of Colleges (AoC) said:


  The Lifelong Loan Entitlement (LLE) has the potential to be a game-changer, as an important part of a stronger
system of lifelong learning in England, so it is good to see the Bill and this publication. I hope that this heralds
the beginning of a major cultural shift in England to change thinking about post-18 education and training. With
people working for over 50 years amidst enormous technological and societal changes, flexible, modular
learning needs to become more mainstream.

  The Bill and this publication address some of the technical challenges of implementation, including the capacity
of the Student Loan Company and the definition of modules. Beyond that, though, we need to see more thinking
about how LLE fits into the whole tertiary education offer, including FE and apprenticeships, at every level and
particularly at Level 3 and below, because demand at Level 4 depends on pathways for adults to take form lower
levels.



  Whilst the need for a lifelong learning culture is clear – with an ageing population, a lack of people with
technical skills needed by employers, technological change and the need to move rapidly to a net zero
economy, we need a whole system approach to ensure every adult has the capacity, motivation and
opportunities to carry on learning throughout their lives at all levels. The LLE might help with that, but on its own
it will not be sufficient to change the behaviours and priorities of the vast majority of people who believe that
achieving a Bachelor’s degree is the gold standard.


Alex Hall-Chen, IoD Principal Policy Advisor for Sustainability, Skills, and Employment said:


  The Lifelong Loan Entitlement has the potential to transform how individuals access training across their
lifetimes, and we welcome the additional clarity provided by the government’s consultation response. In
particular, enabling funding for individual modules as well as full courses, and removing ELQ restrictions to
accessing funding, will support learners to access the training they need to train, retrain, and upskill throughout
their working lives, helping employers to access the skills they need.


Professor David Latchman,Vice Chancellor of Birkbeck University of London said:


  This year Birkbeck is celebrating its 200th anniversary as a specialist provider of lifelong
learning ,so we welcome the announcement of the Government’s detailed LLE proposals
which will support people to learn throughout their lives.

  The Government’s excellent proposals will for the first-time place lifelong learning at the
centre of our education system as is essential to meet the changes in the skills needed in
today’s world.

  We particularly welcome the abolition of the ELQ rule that currently prevents people from
securing a loan to cover tuition fees for courses at a level equivalent or lower than those
they hold already, even though these courses are essential for their future career
development.


Clare Marchant, UCAS Chief Executive said:


  Several hundred thousand adult learners sign up to UCAS every year. The lifelong learning entitlement offers an  opportunity to dramatically expand lifelong learning and boost adult skills.

  We look forward to working with  government, as we are on apprenticeships, to ensure all courses under the LLE are available on ucas.com and showcased alongside the high quality, personalised careers advice UCAS is well known for.

  To help ensure LLE is a success for learners, UCAS stands ready to be a national record of achievement where learning credits can be kept alongside careers advice for adults. We will also work closely with universities and
colleges to help with credit transfers, allowing learners to pick and choose credits at different places.


Jamie Cater, Senior Employment Policy Manager at Make UK, The Manufacturers’ Organisation said:


  As UK manufacturing becomes more technologically advanced and environmentally sustainable, higher-level technical skills are increasingly in demand by employers. A crucial part of manufacturers developing a more resilient workforce for the future will be ensuring that their employees can access the right options for upskilling and retraining throughout their careers. The introduction of the Lifelong Loan Entitlement is an important step forward in enabling this to happen – we welcome today’s commitment to introducing the LLE and look forward to continuing to work with the Department for Education to make it a success.


Alex Proudfoot, Independent Higher Education’s CEO said:


  We welcome confirmation of the Lifelong Loan Entitlement, a policy which should herald a new era of innovation, flexibility and diversity in the choices available to students at all ages and stages of their lives.

  The proposals for 2025 finally introduce parity in the funding system between our high quality degree offer and hands-on technical qualifications.

  Industries across the UK are crying out for new recruits with cutting-edge skills, and they can’t always wait for  degrees to catch up. Independent providers specialise in more flexible approaches to connecting students of all ages with the knowledge and skills they need to get ahead in their career.

  This innovation has always come naturally to these education pioneers, but they have been waiting a long time for funding policy to catch up. Now it has.


To prepare for 2025, and to help more people access Higher Technical Qualifications or Higher Technical education, the government has made £20 million available to support around 80 colleges and universities across England. The funding will be used to support providers to deliver courses in areas such as digital, health & science and engineering and will ensure more people can access the right training to support them into work.

15/11/2022,Over seven million payments of £324 have already been made to low-income families through the government’s cost of living support.,"
    
          This means £2.3 billion has been paid out to over 99% of those eligible via DWP across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland since the beginning of the rollout last Tuesday.

A further one million families eligible solely through tax credits will receive their payment between 23 and 30 November.

Eligible claimants who have not yet received their payment should not be concerned, as the DWP expects some payments may take until 23 November to come through. After this date, a GOV.UK page for reporting missing Cost of Living Payments will become available and the DWP will begin processing claims to ensure outstanding payments reach those eligible as quickly as possible.

There are also a small number of cases where an automated payment has not been possible, for example Universal Credit cases where benefit payments are split between a couple, or where the emergency payment system (EPS) cannot recognise their claim details. A dedicated team of agents are currently working through these cases to pay them manually.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Mel Stride said:


  This Government promised to protect those on the lowest incomes, and it is great to be able to confirm today that we have delivered on this commitment with our latest Cost of Living Payment reaching over seven million households in the last week alone.

  This payment is just part of a wider support package the Government has provided, with millions of families benefiting from a Council Tax rebate and pensioners across the country receiving winter fuel support as the weather gets colder and disabled people getting help with additional costs they face. We will continue to support the most vulnerable as we deal with the impact of Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine and the aftermath of the pandemic.



Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt said:


  We know families are struggling with the rising prices caused by Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. That is why we’ve delivered over 7 million cash payments directly into the bank accounts of the most vulnerable households in just one week and will make over a million more to those on tax credits later this month.

  This is part of the £1,200 cash support we’re giving to the poorest members of society during this difficult period.

  At the upcoming Autumn Statement we will continue to prioritise helping the most vulnerable, as we make the tough decisions needed to drive down inflation and fix our public finances.


To be eligible for the £324 Cost of Living Payment, claimants must have been entitled to one of the qualifying benefits between 26 August and 25 September, with the exception of pensioner households, who may be able to have a new Pension Credit claim backdated.

Pensioners have until 18 December to submit a valid claim for Pension Credit, which could entitle them to the £324 Cost of Living Payment. Anyone can check their eligibility for Pension Credit using the online calculator or by calling the freephone claim line (0800 99 1234).

Even if you are not on a qualifying DWP benefit you may still be eligible for the £324 payment, as HMRC is also making payments to over one million families who only receive Working Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit. These will be automatically paid into bank accounts between 23 and 30 November.

Those eligible do not need to contact the government or apply for the payment at any stage. Payments will appear on bank statements with a reference including the recipients National Insurance number followed by:

‘DWP COL’ for those on DWP means-tested benefits
  ‘HMRC COLS’ for those on tax credits only
This is the second instalment of the £650 Cost of Living Payment – part of the Government’s £37 billion support package for households – with millions also benefiting from the £400 grant to help with energy bills and 85% of households in bands A to D receiving the £150 Council Tax rebate.

On top of this, nearly one in 10 people have received the Government’s additional £150 disability payment this Autumn, and an estimated eight million pensioner households will receive an extra £300 in their Winter Fuel Payments this winter.
"
03/04/2022,"Pensioners and their loved ones are being urged to take-up Pension Credit, as a new campaign is launched to help those of pension age with the cost of living.","
    
          It comes as new figures show many pensioners could be missing out on Pension Credit, a vital financial boost that can be worth over £3,300 a year.

Starting this month, advertising for Pension Credit will feature in internet search results and on social media, before being expanded to national and regional newspapers.

The Department for Work and Pensions will also be distributing leaflets within local communities, while businesses can also get involved in the campaign by spreading the word to their customers using the department’s digital toolkit and encouraging them to call the claim line between the hours of 8am-6pm.

All State Pension recipients will continue to receive reminders about Pension Credit in the post as part of the department’s annual uprating communications.

Currently, over 1.4 million pensioners in Britain receive Pension Credit. However, many are still not claiming this extra financial help and it is estimated up to £1.7bn is being left unclaimed. This is why the DWP is renewing calls for all pensioners to check if they could be eligible.

Minister for Pensions Guy Opperman said:


  We recognise the challenges some pensioners will be facing with the cost of living which is why promoting Pension Credit is a priority.



  That’s why we’re calling on everyone with retired family, friends and loved ones to check in with them and see if they can get this extra financial support.


The campaign also includes tackling some of the myths that may stop people applying, such as how having savings, a pension or owning a home are not necessarily barriers to receiving Pension Credit.

It also reminds people that even a small award can provide access to a wide range of other benefits – such as help with housing costs, council tax or heating bills. For those over 75, this includes continued entitlement to a free TV licence.

Pension Credit can be claimed by phone and online, ensuring that older people can apply safely and easily, wherever they are. The online Pension Credit calculator is also on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK, said:


  Pension Credit can make a big difference if you’ve reached State Pension Age and haven’t got much money coming in. With prices rising rapidly at the moment it’s more important than ever to claim what’s rightfully yours. We urge any older person who thinks they may be eligible to put in a claim and Age UK is here to provide advice and practical support to help you with the process.



  Pension Credit is something of a well kept secret - many people have simply not heard of it. That’s a real shame because at Age UK we see how much it helps those who actually receive it. We hope this campaign is the first step in a sustained government effort to bring Pension Credit to the older public’s attention, and we warmly support it for this reason. Pension Credit is really important for older people and deserves to be much better known.


Morgan Vine, Head of Policy and Influencing at Independent Age, said: 


  We welcome this campaign to increase Pension Credit uptake. We know this support can be life-changing but for too long, too many people over 65 who are eligible have been missing out.



  Older people have told us that before receiving Pension Credit they would skip meals, struggle with a cold home and feel isolated, as they would turn down opportunities to see people because they couldn’t even afford a cup of tea in a café.



  With the cost-of-living crisis making life even more harsh for people over 65, it has never been more urgent to take action on Pension Credit. Awareness campaigns are one part of the strategic approach that is needed at this critical time, so it is very positive to see the government working with local partners to deliver awareness raising materials.



  We look forward to seeing the impact of this campaign, so that further, fast action can be taken to target those who are missing out.


Pension Credit is designed to help with daily living costs for people over State Pension age and on a low income, though you do not need to be in receipt of State Pension to receive it.

It tops up a person’s income to a minimum of £177.10 per week for single pensioners or £270.30 for couples. These amounts will rise to £182.60 per week for single pensioners and to £278.70 for couples from 11th April.
"
07/03/2023,The most vulnerable will be better supported to access justice despite the rising cost of living thanks to new proposals published today (7 March) to reform the government ‘Help with Fees’ scheme.,"
    
          

new proposals to help people pay court and tribunal fees
  plans include raising income threshold for ‘Help with Fees’ scheme
  intervention will support vulnerable families through rising cost of living


The scheme supports people on low incomes and with little to no savings with court and tribunal fees, ensuring a person’s financial situation does not limit their ability to seek justice.

The government has launched a 12-week consultation to expand the scheme by raising the income threshold for eligibility and providing better targeted support for those on lower incomes.

In the last year alone, the scheme provided over £80 million in financial help for thousands of people so they can exercise their legal rights in a wide range of cases such as family disputes, housing issues and compensation claims for personal injury.

Today’s move could potentially help thousands more people with the costs associated with their court and tribunal fees.

Justice Minister, Mike Freer, said:


  We recognise this is a challenging time financially for people across the country so it is vital we continue to ensure everyone can afford justice.

  The Help with Fees scheme has helped thousands of vulnerable people to pay court fees since its inception in 2013 and our reforms will make the scheme more generous and targeted at those who need it most.


Proposed changes to income thresholds will vary depending on different families and their circumstances, including the age of any children. For example:

For a couple with 2 children under 14, the monthly income threshold would increase from £1,875 per month to £2,980.
  For a single person with no children the threshold would increase from, £1,170 per month to £1,420.
For the first time eligibility for the scheme will also take into account the extra costs associated with looking after a child aged over 14, making sure families in these circumstances benefit from more generous support towards the costs of court and tribunal fees.

To make sure the most financially vulnerable are better supported, the government also plans to change how the scheme is targeted by:

Providing more flexibility for individuals with money in savings and investments by increasing the minimum capital threshold for the scheme. This will allow applicants to have more capital before they become ineligible for the scheme.
  Making it easier for the self-employment and those who work variable shift patterns to qualify as the revised scheme better recognises that income can fluctuate month- on-month.
  Ensuring those on higher incomes contribute more towards their court and tribunal fees, by revising partial fee discounts so the more an individual earns, the more they pay towards their fees.
  Raising the scheme’s age cap to the state pension age of 66 from 61.
To qualify for the scheme an individual needs to be on a low income or be on benefits such as Income Support, Universal Credit or Pension Credit.

Some people on a higher income may still be supported by the scheme. Individuals can check their eligibility and apply for the scheme online.

14/06/2022,David Buttress has been appointed as the Government’s new Cost of Living Business Tsar by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.,"
    
          
David Buttress, former chief executive of Just Eat, has been appointed as the Government’s new Cost of Living Business Tsar by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

Mr Buttress will work in partnership with the private sector to identify, develop and promote new and existing business-led initiatives that support people with rising costs of living – from discounted prices or product offers to the expansion of business-run programmes.

This work will build on the schemes, offers and targeted help that some businesses and organisations are already providing and help raise awareness of the private sector offer to the public, which is in addition to extensive government-funded support. Successful examples include price locking campaigns seen in retailers Asda, Sainsbury’s and Boots, and energy supplier Octopus’s decision to double its hardship support fund, which has helped more than 36,000 people so far.  

The Holiday Activities and Food Programme provides one such opportunity for local level partnerships between sports clubs and supermarkets, backing projects that boost access to free activities and food during the holidays for disadvantaged children, including those in receipt of free school meals.

Mr Buttress will join today (Tuesday 14 June) a roundtable with supermarkets and sports organisations hosted by the Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi, where they will discuss the role that the private sector can play in helping low-income families, including through the Government’s Holiday Activities and Food Programme. 

Representatives from organisations such as Co-op, John Lewis Partnership/Waitrose, Swim England, Sport England, and English Football League are due to attend.

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Steve Barclay said:

“Businesses and organisations across the country have stepped up time and time again when the nation needs it most. The financial pressures people are facing as a result of current global challenges will be no different.

“I am delighted to have David Buttress on board, bringing with him a wealth of experience along with the vigour and ingenuity of business to go even further in efforts to support British families throughout this difficult time.”

David Buttress has a wealth of experience in entrepreneurship and investment – leading Just Eat in the UK from a start-up to becoming Europe’s largest technology IPO in a decade. He is currently Chairman of Dragons Rugby club in Newport and a Venture Partner at 83North Venture Capital.

David Buttress, Cost of Living Business Tsar, said:

“The rising cost of living that we are all facing, both in the UK and globally, provides business and industry with a unique challenge and opportunity to do our bit.

“I am looking forward to working closely with my private sector colleagues, to help support our communities and customers with practical and real cost of living saving initiatives.”

The new role of Cost of Living Business Tsar is the latest strand of Government action to support people with challenging financial pressures.

Last month, the Government announced that eight million of the most vulnerable households (around a third of all UK households) will receive £1,200 this year and all families will receive £400 – this is on top of changes to Universal Credit, National Living Wage and National Insurance thresholds, so that people keep more of what they earn.

This takes total government cost of living support to over £37 billion – higher than other major economies around the world.

The Government has recently launched a new website which brings government support on offer together in one place so the public can see what support they could be eligible for: www.gov.uk/costoflivingsupport

Notes to editors:

David Buttress will work in this role until the end of the year and is a voluntary (unpaid) role.
  He will report to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and PM’s Chief of Staff Steve Barclay.

08/11/2022,Almost one in four families across the UK will receive £324 from the government this month as the latest Cost of Living Payments are sent out from today (8 November 2022).,"
    
          Over 8 million households in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland who claimed qualifying means-tested benefits during the eligibility period will be automatically paid £324 this month, as part of £1,200 worth of direct help for households.

over 8 million benefit claimants to receive £324 this month as part of Cost of Living support
  
DWP claimants will receive their second Cost of Living payment by 23 November 2022, and eligible tax credit claimants, on no other means-tested benefits, will receive it between 23 and 30 November 2022
  payments will automatically be made to everyone eligible, with no need for anyone to apply
The payments, starting today from the Department for Work and Pensions, are made directly into eligible recipients’ bank accounts, with no need for people to apply or do anything to receive it.

The payment reference on DWP recipients’ bank accounts will be their national insurance number, followed by “DWP COL”. For HMRC recipients the payment reference will be “HMRC COLS”.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Mel Stride said:


  We understand that people are struggling and that is why we’ve consistently acted to ensure millions of low-income families are supported. We will continue to act with compassion as we navigate challenging global economic circumstances.

  As part of a wider £37 billion package of support, this latest £324 payment will help the most vulnerable people in our society who are worrying about their finances through the winter months.


The government’s £1,200 support package contains £400 for energy bills that is being paid in monthly instalments to all domestic energy customers between now and March 2023. It also includes a £150 Council Tax rebate for 85% of all UK households and the previous £326 Cost of Living Payment made by DWP in July and by HMRC in September.

On top of this, nearly one in ten people received the £150 disability payment in September, and a £300 addition to Winter Fuel Payments will go to over eight million pensioner households over the winter.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt added:


  Prices are rising across the world as we manage the aftershock of COVID-19 and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. We recognise that families back home are struggling, which is why we’ve taken decisive action to hold down energy bills this winter, and provided hundreds of pounds of cash support for each vulnerable household.

  As part of that support, over 8 million vulnerable households - almost a quarter of families in the UK – will automatically receive a second cost of living payment worth £324 in their bank account from today.

  And while we can’t completely protect people from rising prices, my priority at the upcoming Autumn Statement will be to protect the poorest in society as we take the tough decisions necessary to fix our public finances.


Those eligible to receive the second cost of living payment from today include people on:

Universal Credit
  Income-based Jobseekers Allowance (JSA)
  Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
  Income Support
  Pension Credit
To be eligible, claimants must have been claiming and entitled to a payment between 26 August and 25 September 2022, with the exception of pensioner households, who may be able to have a new Pension Credit claim backdated.

They have until 18 December 2022 to submit a valid claim for Pension Credit, which could entitle them to the £324 Cost of Living payment. Anyone can check their eligibility for Pension Credit using the online calculator or by calling the freephone claim line, on: 0800 99 1234.

Even if you are not on a qualifying DWP benefit you may still be eligible for the £324 payment, as HMRC are also making payments to over a million people who receive Working Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit and no other eligible benefits. These will be paid between 23 and 30 November 2022 and customers do not need to contact the government or apply for the payment at any stage.

The £324 payment and the overall £1,200 package come on top of wide-ranging government support with the cost of living this winter, including an extension to the Household Support Fund, which is providing an extra £421 million between October and March to help vulnerable people with the essentials.

As well as this, the Energy Price Guarantee is ensuring people across the country pay significantly less for their energy bills, with a typical household saving around £700 this winter.

23/03/2022,The Chancellor delivered a Spring Statement today that puts billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working people – unveiling a new Tax Plan to ease the rising cost of living and to deliver the biggest cut to personal taxes in a quarter of a century.,"
    
          
Chancellor announces tax cut for nearly 30 million UK workers through rise in National Insurance thresholds – saving the typical employee over £330 in the year from July.
  Unveiling a Tax Plan to give families further help with the cost of living, Rishi Sunak reduces fuel duty on petrol and diesel by 5p per litre for the next year – and announces a £5 billion income tax cut from 2024.
  Spring Statement also sets out measures to boost investment, innovation, and growth – including a £1,000 increase to Employment Allowance to benefit around half a million SMEs.
Rishi Sunak announced that National Insurance starting thresholds will rise to £12,570 from July, meaning hard-working people across the UK will keep more of what they earn before they start paying personal taxes.

The cut, worth over £6 billion, will benefit almost 30 million working people with a typical employee saving over £330 in the year from July. This means the UK now has some of the most generous tax thresholds in the world.

Mr Sunak also announced that fuel duty for petrol and diesel will be cut by 5p per litre from 6pm tonight (23 March) to help drivers across the UK with rising costs – a tax cut worth £2.4 billion. This is the biggest cut ever on all fuel duty rates and means a one-car family will now save on average £100.

To let people keep more of what they earn, the basic rate of income tax will also be cut by 1p in the pound in 2024, when the OBR expect inflation to be back under control, debt falling sustainably and the economy growing. The cut is worth £5 billion for workers, savers and pensioners and will be the first cut to the basic rate in 16 years.

The Chancellor also set out a series of measures to help businesses boost investment, innovation, and growth – including a £1,000 increase to Employment Allowance to benefit around half a million smaller firms.

Delivering the Spring Statement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said:


  This statement puts billions back into the pockets of people across the UK and delivers the biggest net cut to personal taxes in over a quarter of a century.

  Like our actions against Russia, I have been able to do this because of our strong economy and the difficult but responsible decisions I have had to make to rebuild our finances following the pandemic.

  Cutting taxes means people have immediate help with the rising cost of living, businesses have better conditions to invest and grow tomorrow, and people keep more of what they earn for years to come.


Delivering the statement, the Chancellor made clear that our sanctions against Russia will not be cost-free for people at home, and that Putin’s invasion presents a risk to our economic recovery – as it does to countries all around the world.

However, announcing the further measures to help people deal with rising costs, he said the extra support could only be provided because of the UK’s strong economy and the tough but responsible decisions taken to rebuild our fiscal resilience.

The immediate help for people with the cost of living and support for businesses comes as part of a wider Tax Plan announced by the Chancellor that will also create better conditions for growth and will share proceeds from growth more fairly – ensuring people can keep more of what they earn.

Help with the cost of living

The Chancellor said that global supply chain issues following the pandemic, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, are driving up the cost of living for families across the UK.

To combat this, he announced that from 6pm this evening (23 March) fuel duty will be cut by 5p per litre for 12 months – worth £2.4 billion for hard-working families across the UK.

To ease cost of living pressures for almost 30 million employees, the Chancellor announced that from July 2022, National Insurance thresholds will rise to £12,570 to align with the income tax personal allowance. This simplification means that, from July, 70% of workers who pay NICs will pay less of it, even after accounting for the Health and Social Care Levy. Of those who benefit from the threshold increase, 2.2 million people will be taken out of paying NICs altogether.

To ensure more people can keep more of what they earn for years to come, the Chancellor also announced plans to cut the basic rate of income tax from 20p to 19p from 2024. The historic £5 billion tax cut for workers, pensioners and savers will be worth £175 on average for 30 million people and will be the first cut to the basic rate in 16 years. This will be delivered in a responsible and affordable way, while continuing to meet our fiscal rules.

Mr Sunak also announced that there will be an extra £500 million for the Household Support Fund, which doubles its total amount to £1 billion to support the most vulnerable families with their essentials over the coming months. The Chancellor also reduced the VAT on energy saving materials such as solar panels, heating pumps and roof insulation from 5% to zero for five years, helping families become more energy-efficient.
This cost of living support comes on top of the measures that the Chancellor has already announced over the recent months to support families. This includes a £9 billion energy bill rebate package, worth up to £350 each for around 28 million households, an increase to the National Living Wage, worth £1,000 for full time workers, and a cut to the Universal Credit taper, worth £1,000 for two million families.

Boosting Investment, Innovation and Growth

To lift growth and productivity among UK businesses, Mr Sunak set out plans to boost private sector investment and innovation and bring in a new culture of enterprise.

He increased the Employment Allowance – a relief which allows smaller businesses to reduce their employers National Insurance contributions bills each year – from £4,000 to £5,000. The cut is worth up to £1,000 for half a million smaller businesses and starts in two weeks’ time, on 6 April. As a result, 50,000 of these businesses will be taken out of paying NICs and the Health and Social Care Levy, taking the total number of firms not paying NICs and the Levy to 670,000.

The Chancellor also announced two new business rates reliefs will be brought forward by a year to come into effect in April 2022. There will be no business rates due on a range of green technology used to decarbonise buildings, including solar panels and batteries, whilst eligible heat networks will also receive 100% relief. Together these will save businesses more than £200 million over the next five years.

Ahead of the end of the super-deduction, the government will work with businesses and other stakeholders to consider cuts and reforms to best support future investment. And with UK employers spending just half the European average on training their employees, the Chancellor said he will examine how the tax system - including the operation of the Apprenticeship Levy – can be used to encourage employers to invest in adult training.

The Chancellor committed to improving R&D reliefs too. UK business R&D investment is less than half of the OECD’s average as a percentage of GDP, so R&D tax reliefs will be reformed to deliver better value for money for the taxpayer while being more generous where they can make the most difference. The scope of reliefs will also be expanded to cover data, cloud computing and pure maths.

The support for SMEs comes on top of 50% business rates relief for eligible retail, hospitality, and leisure properties, also coming in this April and worth £1.7 billion for small businesses. The Help to Grow Management and Digital schemes, worth thousands of pounds per business, and the £1 million Annual Investment Allowance are also available to continue supporting UK businesses.

Further announcements

The Spring Statement also confirms that:

A new Efficiency and Value for Money Committee will be set up to cut £5.5 billion worth of cross-Whitehall waste – with savings to be used to fund public services.
  £50 million new funding will be provided to create a Public Sector Fraud Authority to hold departments account for their counter-fraud performance and to help them identify, seize and recover fraudsters money.
  Local residents across the UK will benefit from a fresh set of infrastructure projects as we open the second round of the £4.8 billion Levelling Up Fund. It will continue to focus on regeneration, transport and cultural investments."

The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said:


  We’re facing incredibly tough global economic headwinds and families across the country are feeling the pinch.

  That’s why this government is providing an unprecedent £37bn worth of support to help households through the storm.

  Both the public and private sector have a role to play here – and that’s why it’s great to see so many leading UK businesses are now coming forward to offer new deals and discounts that will provide much needed respite at the checkout.

  This won’t solve the issue overnight but it’s yet another weapon in our arsenal as we fight back against scourge of rising prices and inflation.


To mark the launch of the bespoke cost of living deals, the Prime Minister and David Buttress will host a meeting of senior business leaders involved in the campaign in No10 tomorrow [Thursday] to thank the businesses involved and discuss new ideas for cutting the cost of living.

Cost of Living Business Tsar David Buttress will also thank businesses for their support and praise the campaign’s “good start” while making clear that “we’ve got more to do and more deals to announce - not just over the summer holidays but when kids return to school and in the run up to Christmas when costs are typically higher”.

These deals build on the £37bn package of Help for Households already being provided by government – including tax cuts and help towards energy, childcare and transport costs.

01/09/2022,Around 90% of eligible households have received the government’s £150 council tax rebate to help with the cost of living.,"
    
          

Around 9 out of 10 of eligible households have received £150 cost of living rebate
  Anyone yet to receive the rebate can make a claim to local authority
  Rebate part of £37 billion of government support to tackle cost of living crisis


Around 90% of eligible households have received the government’s £150 council tax rebate to help with the cost of living.

Figures published today show 16.6 million households in England, 86% of those eligible, were handed payments by the end of July – meaning the actual number of those who have received the rebate by now will be even higher as councils continue to pay it out.

Today’s figures show a total of £2.5 billion has gone to households in council tax bands A to D under the scheme, an increase of more than £500 million on the previous month.

All councils in England have begun making these payments and have payment processes in place for people who do not pay by direct debit. DLUHC will continue to drive progress with councils to pay households as soon as possible where they have not already done so.

Households have until the end of September to claim the £150 payment, which does not have to be paid back. Anyone who is yet to receive their rebate is urged to check their local council website for more information and make a claim.

However, recognising the importance of the rebate in helping those most in need with rising costs, the government urges councils to do everything they can to encourage the remaining households to claim their rebate to ensure as many eligible households as possible get the money that they are owed.

An extra £144 million has also be given to councils to provide discretionary support to any household in financial need due to rising energy bills, including transient groups and people on low incomes in council tax bands E to H.

Levelling Up Secretary Greg Clark said:


  I’m pleased to see further progress in paying the council tax rebate out to the millions of households who are eligible to receive it.

  We want to make sure that those most in need receive the support that they are entitled to help households with the cost of living. This is why I am urging everyone to check their eligibility to receive the rebate and contact their councils if they have not.


The rebate is part of £37 billion of government support being targeted at those most in need to help with the cost of living. This includes at least £1,200 of extra support for millions of the most vulnerable households this year, with all domestic electricity customers receiving at least £400 towards their bills.

The rebate is available to most households living in council tax bands A to D on 1 April. This includes those who receive Local Council Tax Support, even if their council tax bill for the year is less than £150.

Anyone who thinks they are eligible but does not have a direct debit and has not received a payment or details of how to make a claim, should visit their local council’s website for more information.

Since announcing the rebate in April, the government has provided £28 million for councils to set up software and recruit staff and will top this up as necessary to cover all reasonable delivery costs. Councils have been given a host of options to make payments quickly and securely including bank account transfers, council tax account credits or a voucher-based system.

Local authorities must also make arrangements for those who cannot access the internet.

If households do not know who their local council is, they can find their website through entering their postcode.

06/01/2023,Changes are being made on 10 January 2023 to ensure individuals receiving cost of living support payments are not disadvantaged when applying for legal aid.,"
    
          
Amendments to civil and crime regulations take effect on 10 January to protect legal aid clients receiving cost of living support payments.

Why is this happening now?

Financial support payments are being made by the government to help the vulnerable during the cost of living crisis. Making this change now will align this initiative with legal aid eligibility assessments.

The idea is to ensure funds received under this government initiative do not have to be used to pay for legal services.

Which payments are being disregarded?

The payments which will be disregarded from 10 January 2023 are being made under the:


    Energy Prices Act 2022
  
  
    Social Security (Additional Payments) Act 2022
  
This change means expanding the list of payments to be disregarded when calculating an individual’s financial eligibility for legal aid.

Which areas of legal aid are affected?

The changes, to include these new disregards, will apply to both the civil and criminal legal aid means test schemes. They will come into effect on 10 January 2023.

Where can I find out more?

Amendments to legal aid eligibility legislation can be found in the relevant civil and crime regulations listed below.

We are also updating GOV.UK guidance on 10 January to explain what these payments are and what you need to disregard when making financial determinations.

A total of more than £2 billion has been handed to 15 million households in England under the scheme. Over 90% of households who had direct debits set up with their local council have received their council tax rebate.

The figures cover the period to the end of June, meaning the actual number of households who have received the rebate is likely to be even higher as councils continue to pay it out.

All councils have begun making these payments and almost all councils have payment processes in place for people who do not pay by direct debit. Minister for State Paul Scully has spoken to the 4 councils who do not yet have these processes in place to ensure that they do so as soon as possible.

Households have until the end of September to claim the £150 payment, which does not have to be paid back. Anyone who is yet to receive their rebate is urged to check their local council website for more information and make a claim.

However, recognising the importance of the rebate in helping those most in need with rising costs, the government urges councils to keep pace in supporting the remaining households to claim their rebate.

The rebate is part of £37 billion of government support being targeted at those most in need to help with the cost of living. This includes at least £1,200 of extra support for millions of the most vulnerable households this year, with all domestic electricity customers receiving at least £400 towards their bills.

Anyone who thinks they are eligible but does not have a direct debit and has not received a payment or details of how to make a claim, should visit their local council’s website for more information.

Since announcing the rebate in April, the government has provided £28 million for councils to set up software and recruit staff and will top this up as necessary to cover all reasonable delivery costs. Councils have been given a host of options to make payments quickly and securely including bank account transfers, council tax account credits or a voucher-based system.

Local authorities must also make arrangements for those who cannot access the internet.

If households do not know who their local council is, they can find their website through entering their postcode at Find your local council.

24/03/2022,CMA Chair Jonathan Scott says competition is “more important than ever before” as concerns mount over the cost of living.,"
    
          The Annual Plan explains how the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will protect consumers, promote competition and help support the economy in the year ahead. It aims to encourage innovation, productivity, and sustainable growth to benefit all nations and regions of the UK.

Jonathan Scott, Chair of the CMA, said:


  At a time of rising concern over the cost of living, competitive markets have a crucial role to play in keeping prices for consumers as low as possible. Competition will also be vital for promoting innovation, productivity and growth in our economy.

  Over the last year, we have worked tirelessly to achieve great results for people in the UK, including securing refunds for people whose holidays were cancelled; freeing people from costly ground rent clauses; and launching our first investigations to crack down on companies that make misleading green claims. Looking to the year ahead, competition will be more important than ever before, and our Annual Plan outlines our continued commitment to boosting competition and protecting consumers.


In 2022 to 2023, the CMA will focus on the following themes:

Protecting consumers from unfair behaviour by businesses, during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic
  Fostering competition to promote innovation, productivity and long-term growth right across the UK
  Promoting effective competition in digital markets
  Supporting the transition to low carbon growth, including through the development of healthy competitive markets in sustainable products and services
  Delivering our new responsibilities and strengthening our position as a global competition and consumer protection authority
During the consultation process for the draft Annual Plan, the CMA sought insight directly from consumers, representative charities, and businesses. As well as receiving 19 written submissions from organisations that overwhelmingly supported the themes set out in the plan, the CMA held meetings with stakeholders and hosted events across all 4 nations of the UK.

20/10/2022,Tax credits only customers will receive their second Cost of Living payment from 23 November 2022.,"
    
          
More than one million claimant families receiving tax credits, and no other means-tested benefits, will get their second Cost of Living Payment from Wednesday 23 November 2022, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has confirmed.

This £324 government payment will be paid automatically into most eligible tax credit-only customers’ bank accounts between 23 and 30 November 2022 across the United Kingdom.

Angela MacDonald, HMRC’s Deputy Chief Executive and Second Permanent Secretary, said:


  This second Cost of Living Payment will provide further financial support to eligible tax credit-only claimants across the UK.



  The £324 will be paid automatically into bank accounts, so people don’t need to do anything to receive this extra help.


The second payment will see more than 8 million households across the UK receive their £324 cost of living cash boost by 30 November and follows the first cost of living payments of £326, which eligible families received from Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) from July and HMRC from September.

The government recently announced that households receiving DWP benefits will get their second Cost of Living Payment from 8 November continuing through to 23 November. This includes tax credit claimants who also receive other income-related benefits from DWP.

HMRC is making payments shortly after DWP in order to avoid duplicate payments.

This latest payment comes on top of wider government support with the cost of living this autumn and winter, including:

the £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment, already paid to around 6 million disabled people
  more than 8 million pensioner households who will receive an extra one-off £300 Winter Fuel Payment this year
This is in addition to an extension to the Household Support Fund, which is providing an extra £421 million for use between October 2022 and March 2023 to help vulnerable people with the essentials. A £150 Council Tax rebate was sent earlier this year to those in Council Tax bands A to D in England, creating at least £1,200 in direct support for millions of households.

A £400 reduction on energy bills is also being given to all domestic electricity customers over the coming months, and the Energy Price Guarantee is protecting households from significant rises in their energy bills this winter.

The government is offering help for households. Customers should check GOV.UK to find out what cost of living support they could be eligible for.
"
25/08/2022,"Around 1.1 million claimant families receiving tax credits will get their first Cost of Living Payment from Friday 2 September 2022, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has confirmed.","
    
          
This £326 government payment will be paid automatically into eligible tax credit-only customers’ bank accounts between 2 and 7 September 2022. The first HMRC payments will total around £360 million.

Nadhim Zahawi, Chancellor of the Exchequer, said:


  I know people are really concerned by rising prices so I’m glad that over a million more low earners will shortly receive their first Cost of Living Payment. We are also preparing options for further support so the new Prime Minister can hit the ground running.



  Alongside £400 off most people’s energy bills, tax cuts and the Household Support Fund, these direct payments are a very important part of our £37 billion package of help for households, which is targeted at those who need it most.


Angela MacDonald, HMRC’s Deputy Chief Executive and Second Permanent Secretary, said:


  This first Cost of Living Payment will provide vital financial support for eligible tax credit-only claimants across the UK. A second payment will be made to eligible customers from the winter.



  The money will be paid automatically into bank accounts, so people don’t need to do anything to get this extra help.


These latest payments mean that more than eight million eligible households in receipt of a means-tested benefit will have received the first of two automatic Cost of Living payments of £326 from 14 July. The second means-tested payment of £324 will be issued later this year – from the autumn for Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefit claimants, and from the winter for tax credit-only customers.

Tax credit claimants who also receive benefits from the DWP will have already received their first Cost of Living Payment from July 2022.

The Cost of Living payments from the government are part of a £37 billion package of support, which will see millions of low-income households receive at least £1,200 this year to help cover rising costs.

As well as the Cost of Living Payment, other government support includes:

£400 discount from the government to help with the cost of energy bills from October onwards
  £150 council tax rebate for council tax bands A-D in England
  £300 Pensioner Cost of Living Payment that will be paid alongside Winter Fuel Payments
  £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment from 20 September for those receiving an eligible UK disability benefit
This is all in addition to changes to the Universal Credit taper rate and work allowances worth £1,000 a year on average for 1.7 million working claimants; a rise in the National Living Wage to £9.50 an hour; and a tax cut for around 30 million workers through a rise in National Insurance contribution thresholds.

The government is offering help for households. Customers should check GOV.UK to find out what cost of living support they could be eligible for.

15/11/2022,The recent announcement by Wandsworth Council to support its residents through the cost-of-living crisis now includes property buyers.,"
    
          Today (15 November 2022), the council transferred its local land charges (LLC) service to the national LLC Register, giving citizens and businesses instant access to the information.

The LLC search is an important part of the conveyancing process, revealing restrictions and prohibitions affecting land and property. Common charges include planning permissions, listed building status and tree preservation orders.

London Borough of Wandsworth Council Leader Simon Hogg said:


  For the first time property buyers in the Wandsworth area will have instant access to LLC information free of charge. Or they can opt to pay £15 for an official guaranteed search.

  The council is absolutely committed to making sure it does everything possible to help people through this crisis. This includes helping property buyers to get the information they need quickly and simply, so their transactions are not compromised.


Property buyers are not the only beneficiaries of a modernised LLC service, local authorities also report increased efficiencies. The transformation of paper, microfiche and electronic charges into digital records provides greater data transparency. Council teams can access the information easily, reducing interdepartmental questions, and increasing speed of service.

Continued monitoring and analysis of the register’s data has also identified opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce potential compensation risks. Recent analysis identified a lapse between a council’s finance and housing department teams, resulting in the delayed registration of housing grant charges. The council had awarded hundreds of grants to local families. A sample test of 10 unregistered charges revealed the council risked losing more than £500,000, because a grant term could not be enforced.

HM Land Registry is working with local authorities to ensure the register continues to deliver service levels that customers expect and deserve. To celebrates local authorities who have outstanding management of the register and communicate well with us, we have launched a new award supported by Land Data.

The Best Performing Migrated Local Authority award is for local authorities who have transferred their data to the LLC Register. From 1 December 2022 to 1 February 2023, HM Land Registry will analyse live register data to identify the most outstanding authority. Four performance indicators will be used when judging. These include the time taken to register new charges, completeness of entries, accuracy of entries and the time taken to correct errors.

We are delighted that an increase in the speed of migrations has resulted in more local authorities joining the register, including Wandsworth Council, which is one of the largest boroughs in London. By 2025, we aim to make all LLC searches in England and Wales accessible online, enabling property buyers, conveyancers, developers, policymakers and innovators to access the information they need instantly.


"
29/11/2022,The UK’s biggest broadband and mobile operators have today met with the government to follow up on commitments agreed in the summer to support customers with the cost of living.,"
    
          
Summit comes as the government launches a public awareness campaign to raise awareness of cut-price social tariffs
  Attendees identified the barriers for those not currently taking up social tariffs starting at £10
  Minister urged telecoms companies to consider the impact price rises may have on struggling households
The UK’s biggest broadband and mobile operators have today met with the government to follow up on commitments agreed in the summer to support customers with the cost of living.

Digital minister Julia Lopez called together leaders from the telecoms sector - including BT, Virgin Media, O2, Sky, Vodafone, TalkTalk, Three Mobile, Hyperoptic and Ofcom - at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) for an update on work to boost awareness of social tariffs.

Minister Lopez urged the sector to commit to raising awareness of these affordable deals available for people in receipt of Universal Credit, which could save them up to £180 per year when compared to the average tariff.

An Ofcom report in September found that only 31 per cent of eligible groups were aware that social tariffs were available, despite them being available in 99 per cent of the UK to reach those who need the support most.

The meeting took place on the day the government launched a UK-wide public awareness campaign as part of its Help for Households programme. The campaign aims to help people through the cost of living this winter and will help increase awareness and uptake of the cut-price broadband and mobile deals available to help those struggling with bills.

As well as agreeing to make vital steps to make sure eligible customers know about social tariffs starting from as little as £10, the industry agreed to share insight into the barriers beyond consumer awareness that are preventing households from taking up social tariffs.

The Minister also reminded broadband and mobile companies to be mindful of the impact price rises have on households struggling with the global rise in the cost of living.

In a move welcomed by the government, attendee Hyperoptic also marked the occasion by announcing that they will be dropping the price of their fastest speed social tariff from £25 to just £20.

Digital Infrastructure Minister Julia Lopez, said:


  Helping families manage the cost of living is a priority for this winter and beyond. It is vital to find out what more we and the telecoms industry can do to support families worried about their bills.



  Everyone should have access to affordable mobile and broadband services. Today we agreed that more has to be done to raise awareness of social tariffs and stressed the impact price increases have on people and families up and down the country.


Minister for Social Mobility, Youth and Progression Mims Davies said:


  We have already made it easier for vulnerable families receiving certain benefits to access cheaper broadband rates through our automatic verification system. I do welcome today’s discussion which further shows our commitment to working innovatively with industry to keep low-income families connected and able to progress as a result of this support.



  Social tariffs are just one of the ways we are assisting households at this challenging time, with millions already receiving £1,200 in direct payments and more on the way next year. I encourage anyone who thinks they might be entitled to further support to check their eligibility via our online benefits calculator.


The move follows a roundtable in June where the Government and operators agreed a raft of new commitments to support people with rising costs, including more manageable payments and switching to a cheaper deal free-of-charge.

Following this, the Department for Work and Pensions also launched a new service to verify – with customers’ permission – whether they are in receipt of a relevant benefit and therefore eligible for extra financial support such as a social tariff. The new system will simplify the process by removing the need for customers to prove their entitlement to broadband providers as regularly as every month.

ENDS

Notes to Editors

In June, the government agreed five commitments with industry to support customers who may be struggling. These are outlined here.
  A list of the available low-cost social tariffs can be found here.
Marc Allera, CEO BT Consumer brands EE, BT and Plusnet, said:


  Supporting our customers, especially those most in need, is hugely important to us. Our low cost social tariffs for broadband and mobile support those customers who are worried about their finances and need extra help.
“Digital connectivity is increasingly important to everyone, so I’m pleased to join discussions with Ministers and industry leaders on how Government and industry can work better together to develop programs that are both fair and sustainable.”


Nicola Green, Chief Communications & Corporate Affairs Officer from Virgin Media said:


  Virgin Media O2 is committed to supporting digital inclusion and helping our customers through the cost of living crisis.



  We launched our Essential Broadband social tariff over two years ago and since launch have reduced its price and introduced a new tier for customers who want more data.



  We will also expand customer eligibility for Essential Broadband, enabling more people to enjoy broadband at a lower price.  We are delighted, therefore, to support the Government’s campaign to promote broadband social tariffs.


Rocio Concha, Which? Director of Policy and Advocacy, said:


  Social tariffs can be a hugely valuable tool to help people who are struggling financially during the cost of living crisis, yet far too few customers are aware they exist and take up is very low.



  Working together, government and providers have the potential to ensure millions of eligible customers get the vital connectivity they need at an affordable price.


Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom’s Networks and Communications Group Director, said:


  Social tariffs can make a big difference for people who are struggling with rising bills. Since Ofcom started shining a light on this issue two years ago, the number of providers offering them has increased from two to fourteen.



  But millions of eligible households are still missing out on these packages. So there needs to be a much stronger emphasis on offering and promoting them so low-income households can get the help they urgently need.


Dr Emma Stone, Director of Evidence and Engagement from Good Things Foundation said: “


  We want to help everyone and every household stay connected through this crisis. Today’s roundtable, alongside initiatives like our National Databank – gifting free mobile data donated by Virgin Media O2, Vodafone and Three UK – show that there is will and commitment to act together.


Dana Tobak, Chief Executive of Hyperoptic said:


  I’m encouraged to see our industry coming together to address the rising cost of living. At Hyperoptic, we commissioned research to inform measures network operators can take to tackle digital poverty. Since then we have put that research into action with our ‘fair fibre framework’, a list of commitments we are making to support our customers through the rising cost of living.

16/03/2023,A £27 billion tax cut for business and a trio of freezes to help families with the cost-of-living headlined the Chancellor’s Spring Budget ,"
    
          
A £27 billion tax cut for business through radical ‘full expensing’ policy and capital allowances reform which will drive investment and growth.
  This government will simplify tax for SMEs with over 340,000 businesses in Scotland set to benefit.
  The broad shoulders of the UK mean that measures to ease cost-of-living burden will help more than halve inflation with the extension of Energy Price Guarantee kept at current level, and duties on fuel and a pub pint both frozen.
  Biggest ever set of reforms to remove the barriers that stop those on benefits, older workers, and those with health conditions who want to work from working.
  The government is launching the refocused Investment Zones programme to catalyse 12 high-potential knowledge-intensive growth clusters across the UK, including four across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
A £27 billion tax cut for business and a trio of freezes to help families with the cost-of-living headlined the Chancellor’s Spring Budget today, Wednesday 15 March.

Aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable economic growth that delivers prosperity with a purpose for the people of the United Kingdom, the Spring Budget breaks down barriers to work, unshackles business investment and tackles labour shortages head on.

Many of today’s decisions on tax and spending apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As a result of decisions that do not apply UK-wide, the Scottish Government will receive around an additional £320 million over 2023-24 and 2024-25.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt said:

“Our plan is working – inflation falling, debt down and a growing economy.

“Britain is on a lasting path to growth with a revolution in childcare support, the biggest ever employment package and the best investment incentives in Europe.”

Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said:

“Today the Chancellor has set out a Budget which continues cost of living support and will deliver sustainable, long-term growth, helping us halve inflation and reduce our national debt.

“Maintaining the Energy Price Guarantee until June will save the average family £160 a year and gives certainty over their bills until summer. We’ve also made changes to Universal Credit to help people get back to work.

“Other UK Government direct investment in Scotland includes £8.6 million for Edinburgh’s world-class festivals, more than £1 million for five new vital community ownership projects, and investment in Scotland’s innovative high tech sector. The Chancellor has also confirmed there will be Investment Zones in all parts of the UK, building on Scotland’s two new Freeports.”

The Chancellor announced the government will pay the childcare costs of parents on Universal Credit moving into work or increasing their hours upfront, rather than in arrears – removing a major barrier to work for those who are on benefits. The maximum they can claim will also be boosted to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children – an increase of around 50%.

The Chancellor went on to set out plans to continue to support households with cost-of-living pressures including keeping the Energy Price Guarantee at £2,500 for the next three months and ending the premium that over 4 million households pay on their prepayment meter, bringing their charges into line with comparable customers who pay by direct debit. Taken together with all the government’s efforts to help households with higher costs, these measures bring the total support to an average of £3,300 per UK household over 2022-23 and 2023-24.

To help household budgets further, the planned 11 pence rise in fuel duty will be cancelled and the 5p cut will be maintained for another twelve months, saving a typical driver another £100 on top of the £100 saved so far since last year’s cut.

The generosity of Draught Relief has also been significantly extended from 5% to 9.2%, so that the duty on an average draught pint of beer served in a pub both does not increase from August and will be up to 11 pence lower than the duty in supermarkets. The commitment to duty on a pub pint being lower than the supermarket has been termed the “Brexit Pubs Guarantee” by the Chancellor, and will support over 2,500 pubs and bars in Scotland.

The Chancellor also set out a comprehensive plan to remove the barriers to work facing those on benefits, those with health conditions and older workers. An increase in the pensions Annual Allowance from £40,000 to £60,000 and the abolition of the Lifetime Allowance will remove the disincentives to working for longer.

In line with the government’s vision for the UK to be the best place in Europe for companies to locate, invest and grow, a new first-in-Europe ‘full expensing’ policy will be introduced to boost business investment in an effective cut to corporation tax of £9 billion per year. This makes the UK the joint first most competitive capital allowances regime in the OECD and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that this will increase business investment by 3% for every year it is in place. Mr Hunt signalled an intention to make this scheme – which covers equipment for factories, computers and other machinery - permanent when responsible to do so.

Accompanying forecasts by the OBR confirm that with the package of measures Mr Hunt set out today, the economy is on track to grow with inflation halved this year and debt falling – meeting all of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s economic priorities. This comes alongside the confirmation that there are no new tax rises within the Spring Budget.

Childcare

Significant reforms to childcare will remove barriers to work for parents receiving Universal Credit not working due to caring responsibilities, reducing discrimination against women and benefitting the wider economy in the process.

Childcare costs of parents moving into work or increasing their hours on Universal Credit paid upfront rather than in arrears, with maximum claim boosted to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children – an increase of around 50%.
Employment

The Chancellor set out a comprehensive plan to remove the barriers to work facing those on benefits, those with health conditions and older workers.

Experienced workers such as senior doctors will benefit from an increase in the pensions annual allowance from £40,000 to £60,000.
  The Lifetime Allowance will also be abolished altogether, simplifying the tax system through taking thousands out of the complexity of pension tax and stopping over 80% of NHS doctors from receiving a tax charge for any additional hours worked.
  The midlife MOT offer will be expanded and improved to ensure people get the best possible financial, health and career guidance well ahead of retirement. There will be an enhanced digital midlife MOT tool and an expansion of DWP’s in person midlife MOTs for 50+ Universal Credit claimants, aiming to reach 40,000 per year.
  A DWP White Paper on disability benefits reform will herald the biggest change to the welfare system in the past ten years. By abolishing the Work Capability Assessment in Great Britain we will separate level of benefit entitlement from an individual’s ability to work.
  Strengthening work search and work preparation requirements for around 700,000 lead carers of children aged 1-12 claiming Universal Credit in Great Britain.
  Increasing the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET), which determines how much support and Work Coach time a claimant will receive based on their earnings, for an individual claimant, from 15 to 18 hours at National Living Wage and removing the couples AET in Great Britain. Over 100,000 non-working or low-earning individuals will be asked to meet more regularly Work Coach support to move into work or increase their earnings.
  The application and enforcement of the Universal Credit sanctions regime will be strengthened, by providing additional training for Work Coaches to apply sanctions effectively, including for claimants who do not look for or take up employment, and automating administrative elements of the sanctions process to reduce error rates and free up work coach time.
  Elsewhere, international talent will be attracted through a new migration package that includes adding five construction occupations to the Shortage Occupation List.
Enterprise

The Chancellor put forward a plan to boost innovation, drive business investment and hold down energy costs.

A ‘full expensing’ policy introduced from 1 April 2023 until 31 March 2026 and an extension to the 50% first-year allowance in the same period – a transformation in capital allowances worth £27 billion to businesses over five years.
  A £500 million per year package of support for 20,000 research and development (R&D) intensive businesses through changes to R&D tax credits.
  Generous reforms to tax reliefs for the creative sectors will ensure theatres, orchestras, museums and galleries are protected against ongoing economic pressures and even more world-class productions are made in the UK.
  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will receive £10 million extra funding over two years to maximise its use of Brexit freedoms and accelerate patient access to treatments. This will allow, from 2024, the MHRA to introduce new, swift approvals systems, speeding up access to treatments already approved by trusted international partners and ground-breaking technologies such as cancer vaccines and AI therapeutics for mental health.
  All of the recommendations from Sir Patrick Vallance’s review into pro-innovation regulation of digital technologies, published alongside Spring Budget today, are to be accepted.
  £900 million of funding for an AI Research Resource and an exascale computer – making the UK one of only a handful of countries to have one – and a commitment to £2.5 billion ten-year quantum research and innovation programme through the government’s new Quantum Strategy.
Levelling Up

To level up growth across the UK and spread opportunity everywhere, local communities will be empowered to command their economic destiny.

Business rates retention expanded to more areas in the next Parliament.
  Deliver 12 Investment Zones across the UK including 4 across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; support local growth projects in every nation of the UK.
  We will also provide £8.6 million of funding to support the Edinburgh Festivals, and £1 million for 5 community projects in Scotland, including Aberfeldy Sports Club in Perthshire, repairs to the Inveraray Pier, and a community grocery shop and cafe in the Kyle Lochalsh in the Highlands.

  The OBR’s Economic and Fiscal Outlook verifies that the two fiscal rules outlined by the Chancellor at the Autumn Statement – that underlying debt must fall as a percentage of GDP by the fifth year of the forecast and that public sector borrowing must be below 3% of GDP over the same period – are met with buffers of £6.5 billion and £39.2 billion respectively.

27/02/2023,"Government launches portal for 900,000 additional GB households to apply for £400 payments towards energy bills","
    
          

Households without a direct relationship to a domestic electricity supplier will be able to apply for government support with their energy bills from today
  With government energy bill support covering roughly half of typical winter bills, ministers urge over 900,000 households eligible for the £400 lump sum to apply as soon as possible
  A telephone helpline is also available from today for people without access to the internet to apply for the payment


900,000 more households across England, Scotland and Wales will benefit from the government’s £400 help with energy bills, as an online application portal opens today.

Households without a direct relationship to an electricity supplier, such as those living in park homes and care homes, can now apply via a secure online portal to receive the support as a one-off, non-repayable lump sum under the ‘alternative funding’ route of the government’s Energy Bills Support Scheme (EBSS AF). For those without online access, a dedicated customer helpline is available to assist eligible customers.

The launch of applications follows months of close work with stakeholders across the country to deliver the government’s help for households with the cost of living. The alternative funding route is the latest in a range of targeted measures which are covering around half of a typical household’s energy bills this winter.

To ensure people feel the benefit of this support as quickly as possible, the payment will be provided directly into people’s bank accounts. Over £7.2 billion has been provided so far to 97% of households across England, Scotland and Wales through monthly instalments, which most households receive automatically in the same way they pay these bills.

The alternative funding route is designed to make sure the same level of support reaches those without a direct relationship to an electricity supplier. It’s also available for households who get their energy through a commercial contract or who are off-grid.

Ministers are today urging all eligible households to apply as soon as possible for their support, whilst also warning households to stay alert to potential scams and report them to relevant authorities where they are suspected.

The government will never provide any links to the application portal, or directly ask individuals to apply for the £400 support. Those that require additional help when applying for support may wish to seek assistance from a family member or trusted friend.

Minister at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, Amanda Solloway, said:


  We understand the pressure households are under which is why we’ve already stepped in to pay around half of people’s energy bills this winter, and from today, thousands more will be able to apply securely for their £400.

  Today I’m urging everyone who couldn’t get their EBSS discounts in the regular way to apply via our secure channels. If you don’t have a direct contract with an electricity supplier, it’s essential you submit your application as soon as possible. The sooner you do, the sooner help can get to you.


The launch of the portal follows a successful pilot scheme with local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales to refine the process, making sure the system can deliver support in a robust, secure and efficient manner.

Once customers have applied to receive energy support and their applications have been processed and verified, eligible customers’ details will be shared with Local Authorities across England, Scotland and Wales, who will deliver the support in one lump sum. Local authorities may request additional information to assist their verification process – but only once an application has been made via the secure portal or helpline. Applicants will only be able to submit information through these channels and should not contact their local authority.

The exact date that an eligible household will receive support will depend on when the application is made and when the payment can be processed by the relevant local authority.

Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps will shortly write to local authorities, thanking them for getting the scheme over the line after working hand in hand with his department over the last three months, and urging them to process applications as quickly as possible so households aren’t left waiting weeks after applying.

He’ll also say there must be no further delays to rolling out the Alternative Fuel Payment Alternative Fund – a similar scheme for households who use alternative fuels as their main source of heating, providing £200 towards energy costs, adding it will be live by 6th March.

This will help people who use alternative energy sources such as heating oil, biomass and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to heat their homes, but who were unable to receive the government’s £200 Alternative Fuel Payment automatically via their electricity supplier. Of nearly 2 million people who use these sources as the main means to heat their homes, around 15% will need to apply through a similar GOV.UK portal which will shortly open to applications.

These schemes are the latest part of a range of targeted measures to help households across the country with the cost of living, which are covering around half of a typical household’s typical energy bills this winter.

In addition to the £400 of total support provided through the EBSS, the government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) is saving a typical UK household £900 over this winter by reducing the unit cost of electricity and gas. Together, the support provided through the EPG and EBSS cover around half of a typical household’s energy bills. The EPG will continue to provide support for another 12 months from April 2023, providing an average of £500 support for households in 2023 to 2024 in the face of energy prices that are forecast to remain high. A further £1,200 of support in direct payments is also being provided to vulnerable households this year, with £26 billion worth of targeted support to help protect the most vulnerable announced by the Chancellor for the next financial year.

Notes to editors

Households eligible to apply for support under EBSS Alternative Funding include:
    care home residents and others in care facilities/sheltered accommodation (wholly or partly self-funded)
      park home residents
      houseboats and caravans that can provide proof of address
      social and private tenants who pay for energy through a landlord on a commercial supply
      homes on a heat network/private wire
      off-grid homes
      farmhouses used for wholly domestic purposes
    
  The EBSS AF is intended to support those households who do not have a direct relationship to a domestic energy supplier, as they do not hold a domestic energy contact themselves, or the intermediary who provides their electricity has a commercial energy contract, such as a landlord. The Energy Prices Act includes measures to make sure EBSS payments under the main scheme are passed on to households who pay for their energy via an intermediary such as a landlord.
  Customers eligible for support under the main Energy Bills Support Scheme are not eligible for support under the alternative funding aspect of the scheme.
  To check eligibility and apply for the £400 of support, people need to search for “Apply for energy bill support if you do not get it automatically” in the search bar on GOV.UK or in an internet search engine.
  The government will never provide any links to the application portal, or directly ask individuals to apply for their support. Those who require additional help when applying for support may wish to seek assistance from a family member or trusted friend.
  For those without online access, the contact centre helpline can be reached on 0808 175 3287 for applicants in Great Britain, or 0808 175 3894 for applicants in Northern Ireland, where a representative will guide them through the application process. The helpline is open 08am to 6pm on Monday to Friday.
  Applicants who are unable to submit a form via the online portal or contact centre, for example due to a medical condition, can have a trusted family member, friend, or carer, apply online on their behalf, as long as the applicant’s details and proof of their consent are provided.
  Applications that pass initial checks are then shared with an applicant’s Local Authority for further verification - either using existing information such as council tax records or they may write to request additional information if this is needed to confirm eligibility. Local Authorities will make the payments to successful applicants.
  The EBSS alternative funding scheme is open to all eligible households across Great Britain and Northern Ireland until 31 May 2023.

14/03/2023,CMA investigation finds Asda’s purchase of 132 petrol stations and attached grocery stores from the Co-op could mean higher prices or less choice for  motorists or shoppers in 13 areas.,"
    
          In January 2023, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened a Phase 1 investigation into the completed acquisition by Asda of Arthur Foodstores Limited, a company set up by Co-op to sell its 132 petrol forecourt sites.

The CMA’s investigation focused on a number of local areas in which Asda and the Co-op sites that it acquired compete to provide fuel or groceries to customers. The CMA found that the deal raises competition concerns in 13 locations across the UK, in each of which the merging businesses currently compete for customers and would not face sufficient competition after the merger. The deal could therefore lead to consumers and businesses in these areas facing higher prices or lower quality services when shopping or buying fuel.

Asda told the CMA that competition concerns would not arise in these areas because the merger would enable Asda to bring its low-cost pricing model to more customers. But as the CMA’s investigation in this case focussed on local areas in which the merging businesses currently compete for customers, competition concerns only arise in areas in which Asda is already an important option for customers, who already have access to Asda prices. The CMA found that allowing Asda to acquire more sites in those areas, leaving it facing insufficient competition in future, could therefore risk worse outcomes for customers.

Colin Raftery, CMA Senior Director of Mergers, said:


  Groceries and fuel account for a large part of most household budgets. As living costs continue to rise, it’s particularly important that deals that reduce competition among groceries and fuel suppliers don’t make the situation worse.

  While competition concerns don’t arise in relation to the vast majority of the 132 sites bought by Asda, there’s a risk that customers could face higher prices or worse services in a small number of areas where Asda would face insufficient competition in either groceries or fuel after the deal goes through”.


Asda now has 5 working days to offer legally binding proposals to the CMA to address the competition concerns identified. The CMA would then have a further 5 working days to consider whether these proposals address its concerns, or if the case should be referred to an in-depth, Phase 2 investigation.

Notes to editors


    For more information, please see the Asda/Arthur (Co-op) case page.
  
  
    One of the 13 locations, in Earlston, Scotland, raised competition concerns in relation to the supply of both petrol and groceries. The 10 other petrol stations that raised concerns are in Barnard Castle; Calcutt, Caledonian Road; Gnosall (Station Road); Lauder; Minsterley; Oakdale (Ripon Road),Harrogate; Rochester; Stonehaven (Kirkton Road); and Weycock Cross in Barry. The two further areas that raised concerns in relation to groceries are the Co-op mid-size stores in St Columb Minor (Henver Road), and East Peckham.
  
  
    Asda is controlled by Mr Zuber Issa, Mr Mohsin Issa, and the private equity firm TDR Capital, who together also own EG Group.
  
  
    The transaction completed on 30 October 2022. The CMA served an initial enforcement order on 26 October 2022 under section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Asda, Mr Mohsin Issa, Mr Zuber Issa, TDR Capital, Co-op, and Arthur.

21/02/2023,"Around 400,000 women across England will get better access to menopause support – saving hundreds of pounds and making treatment more accessible. 
","
    
          
Women in England will be able to access cheaper hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause through a new prescription prepayment certificate (PPC)
  To be rolled out from 1 April 2023, the certificate will help around 400,000 women save hundreds of pounds a year, reducing their HRT costs to less than £20 a year
  Better access to HRT will improve the lives of millions of women in England who suffer from negative symptoms of the menopause
From 1 April 2023, women prescribed HRT - the main treatment for menopause symptoms - will have access to a new scheme enabling access to a year’s worth of menopause prescription items for the cost of 2 single prescription charges (currently £18.70).

As part of commitments to reduce the cost of HRT for menopausal women, the PPC will be valid for 12 months. It can be used against a list of HRT prescription items, and a patient can use this against an unlimited number of HRT items, such as patches, tablets and topical preparations. There will be no limit to how many times the certificate can be used while it is valid.

Reducing the cost of HRT is just one of the steps being taken by the government to improve access to HRT, alongside continuing work with suppliers to encourage and support them to boost supply to meet growing demand.

The introduction of the certificate delivers one of our year 1 priorities for the Women’s Health Strategy for England. Published last summer, the strategy sets out an ambitious new agenda for improving the health and wellbeing of women and girls and to improve how the health and care system listens to women. Menopause was announced as a priority area within the strategy.

Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said:


  This new certificate will make HRT more accessible than ever before - helping around 400,000 women save hundreds of pounds a year.

  This is another step in our drive to improve support for millions of women experiencing the menopause, delivering on our Women’s Health Strategy.


Minister for Women, Maria Caufield, said:


  Around three-quarters of women will experience menopause symptoms, with a quarter experiencing severe symptoms - which can seriously impact their quality of life.

  Reducing the cost of HRT is a huge moment for improving women’s health in this country, and I am proud to be announcing this momentous step forward.

  In our Women’s Health Strategy, we made menopause a top priority. By making HRT more accessible, we’re delivering on our commitment to women.


Women’s Health Ambassador, Dame Lesley Regan, said:


  The menopause is an inevitable stage in a woman’s life course. As a gynaecologist, I’ve witnessed first-hand the symptoms that women experience, which can have debilitating impacts on their daily lives.

  Making HRT more affordable will have a hugely beneficial impact on the lives of so many women. This prepayment certificate is a major step forward in prioritising the health and wellbeing of women.


Around 15% of women aged 45 to 64 in England are currently prescribed HRT, which has increased rapidly in the last 2 years from around 11% and continues to increase.

The government has accepted the recommendations of the HRT Taskforce, including encouraging and supporting manufacturers to boost supply to meet growing demand and continuing to issue serious shortage protocols (SSPs) when needed to even out distribution. This involved allowing alternative products to be dispensed when necessary, and reducing the need for the patient to return to their GP.

The department engages with suppliers on a weekly basis, closely monitors the supply of HRT, and regularly meets with individual suppliers, including hosting quarterly roundtables with industry to ensure a continuous supply of HRT.

Women will need to apply for the PPC through the NHS Business Services Authority or in person at a pharmacy registered to sell PPCs. Once it has been granted, it will be available for use immediately on or after 1 April 2023. When collecting HRT products, patients will be able to simply show the digital or paper copy HRT PPC to the pharmacist and complete the exemption declaration on the NHS prescription form.

Dr Ranee Thakar, President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said:


  We know that cost can be one of the barriers that women face in accessing treatment to manage their symptoms during menopause, and the introduction of HRT PPCs is a positive step to improve access to HRT. This announcement is an important first step, and we hope that more will be done to address the challenges and inequalities faced in accessing menopause care and treatment.


Dr Janet Barter, President of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said:


  We welcome the introduction of HRT PPCs by the Department of Health and Social Care. This is a big step towards improving women’s access to menopause treatment in England and reducing inequalities in access to this essential healthcare. Improved access to HRT will improve the lives of millions of women, allowing them to easily take control of their own menopause.


Janet Lindsay, CEO of Wellbeing of Women, said:


  HRT is a first line treatment for women who may need help with managing menopause symptoms which can be debilitating. Improving access to HRT, by reducing the prescription costs, is absolutely the right thing to do and will help to empower women during this life stage.


The HRT PPC is in addition to the existing help with prescription charges, including the 3 and 12 month PPCs.

For people who need multiple medicines, the existing PPCs may remain a more cost effective method of paying for prescriptions.

09/03/2023,"UKHSA, ONS and the University of Oxford are thanking over 500,000 people from across the UK for their contribution to the COVID-19 Infection Survey.","
    
          Set up in April 2020, the COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS) regularly gathered and analysed more than 11 million swab tests and 3 million blood tests from households.

The results have helped to provide vital weekly data on virus positivity levels across the UK, details on new variants, the characteristics of those who had the virus and their antibody levels and details of long COVID prevalence. This helped develop an understanding of COVID-19 and inform government decision-making throughout the pandemic.

The widespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine programme, together with improved treatments for the most vulnerable, has enabled the transition to living with COVID-19. This means the approach to COVID-19 surveillance is being actively reviewed by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to ensure it is proportionate, cost effective and considered alongside how we monitor a range of other infectious diseases that present a similar risk to the public’s health.

UKHSA will confirm details of any new surveillance surveys that continue beyond 31 March 2023 in due course. In the meantime, data collection for the COVID-19 Infection Survey will be paused.

Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at UKHSA, said:


  The COVID-19 Infection Survey has been an important tool in helping us understand COVID-19 and we’d like to thank every single participant for the huge contribution they have made.

  We will continue to ensure our surveillance activities remain proportionate and cost effective with the move to Living with COVID-19. Participants of the COVID-19 Infection Survey will be uniquely placed to support future surveillance activities and we and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) very much look forward to working with them in the future.

  We remain committed to monitoring the threat posed by COVID-19 through our range of surveillance systems and genomics capabilities, which report on infection rates, hospitalisations and the risks posed by new variants.


Sir Ian Diamond, National Statistician and Chief Executive of the ONS, said:


  The pandemic has been a formidable test of our ability to gather and analyse data quickly, and the unique value of the COVID-19 Infection Survey has been recognised worldwide.

  The data from this survey has had an incredible impact on the country’s response to the pandemic, and its success instils confidence in the ability to stand up wider surveillance activities in future.

  As UKHSA works to confirm its approach to COVID-19 surveillance, we plan to continue gathering valuable insight into the experiences of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections and long COVID in communities, and looking forward to continuing to work with CIS participants to do so.


Professor Sarah Walker, Chief Investigator of the survey and Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology at the University of Oxford, said:


  The COVID-19 Infection Survey is an extraordinary achievement, the successes of which have been driven by the selfless contribution of hundreds of thousands of people taking part across all 4 nations of the UK, as well as of several thousand study workers originally delivering home visits throughout lockdowns.

  The data collected will continue to be valuable for many years to learn more about how COVID-19 infection and vaccination affect future health outcomes.


UKHSA continues to publish regular reports on COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, including through our weekly surveillance reports, which provide data on infection rates, hospitalisation numbers and vaccination uptake. We also maintain the ability to track the latest variants through our genomics capabilities, which assess the risks posed by different strains of the virus.

15/03/2023,Spring Budget 2023 speech as delivered by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt.,"
    
          
Madam Deputy Speaker, in the face of enormous challenges I report today on a British economy which is proving the doubters wrong.

In the autumn we took difficult decisions to deliver stability and sound money.

Since mid-October, 10-year gilt rates have fallen, debt servicing costs are down, mortgage rates are lower and inflation has peaked.

The International Monetary Fund says our approach means the UK economy is on the right track.

But we remain vigilant, and will not hesitate to take whatever steps are necessary for economic stability.

Today the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that because of changing international factors and the measures I take, the UK will not now enter a technical recession this year.

They forecast we will meet the Prime Minister’s priorities to halve inflation, reduce debt and get the economy growing.

We are following the plan and the plan is working.

But that’s not all we’ve done.

In the face of a cost-of-living crisis we have demonstrated our values by protecting struggling families with a £2,500 Energy Price Guarantee, one-off support and the uprating of benefits with inflation.

Taken together, these measures are worth £94 billion over this year and next – one of the largest support packages in Europe.

That averages over £3,300 of cost-of-living help for every household in the country.

Today, we deliver the next part of our plan.

A budget for growth.

Not just the growth that comes when you emerge from a downturn.

But long term, sustainable, healthy growth that pays for our NHS and schools, finds jobs for young people, and provides a safety net for older people all whilst making our country one of the most prosperous in the world.

Prosperity with a purpose.

That’s why growth is one of the Prime Minister’s five priorities for our country.

I deliver that today …

…by removing obstacles that stop businesses investing;

…by tackling labour shortages that stop them recruiting;

…by breaking down barriers that stop people working;

…and by harnessing British ingenuity to make us a science and technology superpower.

Meeting the Prime Minister’s priorities

I start with the forecasts produced by Richard Hughes and his team at the independent Office for Budget Responsibility whom I thank for their diligent work.

They have looked in detail at the Prime Minister’s economic priorities.

Halving inflation

The first of those is to halve inflation.

Inflation destroys the value of hard-earned pay, deters investment and foments industrial strife.

This government remains steadfast in its support for the independent Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England as it takes action to return inflation to the 2% target.

Despite continuing global instability, the OBR report today that inflation in the UK will fall from 10.7% in the final quarter of last year to 2.9% by the end of 2023.

That is more than halving inflation.

High inflation is the root cause of the strikes we have seen in recent months.

We will continue to work hard to settle these disputes but only in a way that does not fuel inflation.

Part of the fall in inflation predicted by the OBR happens because of additional measures I take today.

Firstly, I recognise that even though wholesale energy prices have been falling, there is still enormous pressure on family finances.

Some people remain in real distress and we should always stand ready to help where we can.

So after listening to representations from Martin Lewis and other experts, I today confirm that the Energy Price Guarantee will remain at £2,500 for the next three months.

This means the £2,500 cap for the typical household will remain in place when energy prices remain high, ahead of an expected fall in prices from July.

This measure will save the average family a further £160 on top of the energy support measures already announced.

The second measure concerns over four million households on prepayment meters.

They are often the poorest households, but they currently pay more than comparable customers on direct debit. Ofgem has already agreed with suppliers a temporary suspension to forced installations of prepayment meters.

But today I go further, and confirm we will bring their charges in line with comparable direct debit charges. The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end.

Next I have listened to representations from the hon members for East Devon, North Cornwall, Colne Valley and Central Suffolk and North Ipswich about the risk to community facilities, especially swimming pools, caused by high costs. When times are tough, such facilities matter even more.

So today I am providing a £63 million fund to keep our public leisure centres and pools afloat.

I have also heard from my RHF the charities minister and his Secretary of State about the brilliant work third sector organisations are doing to help people struggling in tough times.

They can often reach people in need that central or local government cannot, so I will give his department £100 million to support thousands of local charities and community organisations do their fantastic work.

I also note the personal courage of one of my predecessors, my RHF from Bromsgrove, in talking about the tragedy of suicide and the importance of preventing it.

We already invest a lot in this area, but I will assign an extra £10 million over the next two years to help the voluntary sector play an even bigger role in stopping more families experiencing such intolerable heartache.

My penultimate cost of living measure concerns one of our other most treasured community institutions, the great British pub.

In December, I extended the alcohol duty freeze until 1 August, after which duties will go up in line with inflation in the usual way.

But today, I will do something that was not possible when we were in the EU and significantly increase the generosity of Draught Relief, so that from 1 August the duty on draught products in pubs will be up to 11p lower than the duty in supermarkets, a differential we will maintain as part of a new Brexit pubs guarantee.

Madam Deputy Speaker, British ale may be warm, but the duty on a pint is frozen.

And even better, thanks to the Windsor Framework negotiated by my RHF the Prime Minister, that change will now also apply to every pub in Northern Ireland.

Finally, I have heard the representations from the Honourable Member from Stoke on Trent North, my Rt Hon Friend for Witham and my Rt Hon Friend from South Thanet and the Sun newspaper about the impact on motorists of the planned 11p rise in fuel duty.

Because inflation remains high, I have decided now is not the right time to uprate fuel duty with inflation or increase the duty.

So here’s what I am going to do: for a further 12 months I’m going to maintain the 5p cut … and I’m going to freeze fuel duty too.

That saves the average driver £100 next year and around £200 since the 5p cut was introduced.

Our Energy Price Guarantee, fuel duty and duty on a pint – all frozen in today’s budget.

Something that doesn’t just help families, it helps the economy too because their combined impact reduces CPI inflation by nearly ¾% this year, lowering inflation when it is particularly high.

Reducing debt

I now turn to the Prime Minister’s second priority, which is to reduce debt.

Here too our plan is on track.

Underlying debt is forecast to be 92.4% of GDP next year, 93.7%  in 2024-25; 94.6% in 2025-26, and 94.8% in 2026-27, before falling to 94.6% in 2027-28.

We are meeting the debt priority.

And with a buffer of £6.5 billion, it means we are meeting our fiscal rule to have debt falling as a percentage of GDP by the fifth year of the forecast.

As a proportion of GDP our debt remains lower than the USA, Canada, France, Italy and Japan.

And because of the decisions I take today, and the improved outlook for the public finances, underlying debt in five years’ time is now forecast to be nearly three percentage points lower than it was in the Autumn.

That means more money for our public services and a lower burden on future generations – deeply-held values which we put into practice today.

At the Autumn Statement I also announced that public sector net borrowing must be below 3% of GDP over the same period.

The OBR confirm today that we are meeting that rule with a buffer of £39.2 bn.

In fact our deficit falls in every single year of the forecast, with borrowing falling from 5.1% of GDP in 2023-24, to 3.2% in 2024-25, 2.8% in 2025-26, 2.2% in 2026-27 and 1.7% in 2027-28.

Even better in the final two years of the forecast our current budget is in surplus, meaning we only borrow for investment and not for day-to-day spending.

Day to day departmental spending will grow at 1% a year on average in real terms after 2024-25 until the end of the forecast period, and capital plans are maintained at the same level set at Autumn Statement.

We will uprate tobacco duty, and we will freeze the gross gaming duty yield bands. We are also maintaining the starting rate for savings and the ISA subscription limits, and we will bring forward a range of measures to tackle promoters of tax avoidance schemes.

But Madam Deputy Speaker, taken together today’s measures lead to a slightly lower overall tax burden for the rest of the parliament compared to the OBR’s Autumn forecast.

We are reducing borrowing and improving our public finances.

By doing so we make sure we are on track to…

… halve inflation

… get debt falling

…and grow our economy, which I turn to next.

Growth

Growth is the Prime Minister’s third priority and the focus of today’s budget.

13 years ago, we inherited an economy that had crashed.

But since 2010 we’ve grown more than major countries like France, Italy or Japan and about the same as Europe’s largest economy Germany.

We’ve halved unemployment…

… cut inequality

…and reduced the number of workless households by one million.

For the first time ever, because of the rises in tax thresholds made by successive Chancellors people in our country can earn £1,000 a month without paying a penny of tax or national insurance.

Those tax reductions have helped lift 2 million people out of absolute poverty, after housing costs, including 400,000 pensioners and 500,000 children.

That averages 80 pensioners and 100 children lifted out of poverty for every single day we’ve been in office.

Today we face the future with extraordinary potential.

The World Bank said that out of all big European countries, we are the best place to do business.

Global chief executives say that apart from America and China, we are the best country to invest in.

We became the second country in the world to have a stock of foreign direct investment worth 2 trillion dollars.

And London has just pipped New York and 53 other global cities to be the best place in the world for female entrepreneurs.

Declinists are wrong about our country for another reason, which is our newfound strength in the innovation industries that will shape this century.

Over the last 13 years we have become the world’s third trillion-dollar tech economy after the US and China.

We have built the largest life sciences sector in Europe, producing a Covid vaccine that saved six million lives and a treatment that saved a million more.

Our film and TV industry has become Europe’s largest, with our creative industries growing at twice the rate of the economy.

Our advanced manufacturing industries produce around half the world’s large civil aircraft wings.

And thanks to a clean energy miracle we have become a world leader in offshore wind.

Other parties talk about a green energy revolution, so I gently remind them that nearly 90% of our solar power was installed in the last 13 years - showing it’s this Government who fix the roof while the sun is shining.

Let’s turn now to what the OBR say about our growth prospects.

In November, they expected that the UK economy would enter recession in 2022 and contract by 1.4% in 2023.

That left many families feeling concerned about the future.

But today, the OBR forecast we will not enter a recession at all this year with a contraction of just 0.2%.

And after this year the UK economy will grow in every single year of the forecast period: by 1.8% in 2024; 2.5% in 2025; 2.1% in 2026; and 1.9% in 2027.

They also expect the unemployment rate to rise by less than one percentage point to 4.4%, with 170,000 fewer people out of work compared to their Autumn forecast.

Defence

Madam Deputy Speaker, that return to growth has direct consequences for our role on the global stage.

I am proud we are giving the brave people of Ukraine more military support than anyone else in Europe.

On Monday we were able to go further with my RHF the Prime Minister announcing a £5bn package of funding for the Ministry of Defence, an additional £2bn next year and £3bn the year after.

Today, following representations from our persuasive Defence Secretary, I confirm that we will add a total of £11 billion to our defence budget over the next five years and it will be nearly 2.25% of GDP by 2025.

We were the first large European country to commit to 2% of GDP for defence and will raise that to 2.5% as soon as fiscal and economic circumstances allow.

Following representations from my RHF the Minister for Veterans Affairs, I am today also increasing support for our brave ex-servicemen and women.

We will provide a package worth over £30 million to increase the capacity of the Office for Veterans’ Affairs, support veterans with injuries returning from their service and increase the availability of veteran housing.

But to be Europe’s biggest defender of democracy, we must build Europe’s most dynamic economy.

That means tackling our longstanding productivity issues including two in particular which I address today: lower business investment and higher economic inactivity than other similar countries.

Too often companies struggle to recruit and even when they do, output per employee is lower.

So today I set out the four pillars of our industrial strategy to address these issues.

Colleagues will know from my Bloomberg speech, they all start with the letter ‘E’: Enterprise, Employment, Education and Everywhere.

I start with ‘Everywhere’, our measures to level up growth across the UK.

Everywhere

This government was elected on a mandate to level up.

We have already allocated nearly £4 billion in over 200 projects across the country through the first two rounds of the Levelling Up Fund. A third round will follow.

Since we started focusing on levelling up, 70% of the growth in salaried jobs has come from outside London and the South-East.

Today we take further steps.

Investment Zones

Canary Wharf and the Liverpool Docks were two outstanding regeneration projects.

I pay tribute to Lord Heseltine for making them happen because they transformed the lives of thousands of people. They showed what’s possible when entrepreneurs, government and local communities come together.

So today I announce that we will deliver 12 new Investment Zones, 12 potential Canary Wharfs.

In England we have identified the following areas as having the potential to host one: West Midlands, Greater Manchester, the North-East, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, East Midlands, Teesside and, once again, Liverpool. There will also be at least one in each of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

To be chosen, each area must identify a location where they can offer a bold and imaginative partnership between local government and a university or research institute in a way that catalyses new innovation clusters.

If the application is successful, they will have access to £80 million of support for a range of interventions including skills, infrastructure, tax reliefs and business rates retention.

Local investment

Working together with our formidable Levelling Up Secretary, I also want to give some further support to levelling up areas under the ‘E’ of everywhere.

First, I will invest over £200 million in high quality local regeneration projects across England including the regeneration of Tipton town centre and the Marsden New Mills Redevelopment Scheme.

I am also announcing a further £161 million for regeneration projects in Mayoral Combined Authorities and the Greater London Authority.

And I will make over £400 million available for new Levelling Up Partnerships in areas that include Redcar and Cleveland, Blackburn, Oldham, Rochdale, Mansfield, South Tyneside, and Bassetlaw.

Having listened to the case for better local transport infrastructure from many hon members, I can announce a second round of the City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements, allocating £8.8 billion over the next five-year funding period.

And following a wet and then cold winter, I also received particularly strong representations from my hon friends from North Devon, South-West Devon and Newton Abbot as well as councillor Peter Martin from my own constituency about the curse of potholes.

The Spending Review allocated £500 million every year to the Potholes Fund but today I have decided to increase that fund by a further £200 million next year to help local communities tackle this problem.

For Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland this Budget delivers not only a new Investment Zone but an additional £320 million for the Scottish Government, £180 million for the Welsh Government and £130 million for the Northern Ireland Executive as a result of Barnett consequentials.

On top of which in Scotland, I can announce up to £8.6 million of targeted funding for the Edinburgh Festivals as well as £1.5 million funding to repair the Cloddach Bridge.

I will provide £20 million of funding for the Welsh Government to restore the Holyhead Breakwater and, in Northern Ireland, I am allocating up to £3 million to extend the Tackling Paramilitarism Programme and up to £40 million to extend further and higher education participation.

Local leadership

But Madam Deputy Speaker, for levelling up to truly succeed we need to unleash the civic entrepreneurship that is only possible when elected local leaders are able to fund and deliver solutions to their own challenges.

That means giving them responsibility for local economic growth and the benefit from the upside when it happens.

So the government will consult on transferring responsibilities for local economic development currently delivered by Local Enterprise Partnerships to support local economic development to local authorities from April 2024.

I will also boost Mayors’ financial autonomy by agreeing multi-year single settlements for the West Midlands and the Greater Combined Manchester Authority at the next spending review, something I intend to roll out for all Mayoral areas over time.

I have also agreed a new long-term commitment so that they can retain 100% of their business rates, something I also hope to expand to other areas over time.

Investment zones, regeneration projects, levelling up partnerships, local transport infrastructure and business rates retention…more control for local communities over their economic destiny so we will level up wealth generation and opportunity everywhere.

Enterprise

Today’s budget is about the Prime Minister’s promise to grow the economy.

We’ve talked about making that growth happen everywhere, so I now move on to my second ‘e’. Enterprise.

We need to be Europe’s most dynamic enterprise economy.

And under this government that is exactly what’s been happening.

Since 2010 we have one million more businesses in the UK, a bigger increase than in Germany, France or Italy.

But I want another million and another million after that.

So today I bring forward enterprise measures in these three areas: to lower business taxes, reduce energy costs and support our growth industries.

Business taxes

Let’s start with business taxation.

We know the importance of a competitive tax regime. We already have lower levels of business taxation than France, Germany, Italy or Japan.

But I want us to have the most pro-business pro-enterprise tax regime anywhere.

Even after the corporation tax rise this April, we will have the lowest headline rate in the G7.

Only 10% of companies will pay the full 25% rate.

But even at 19% our corporation tax regime did not incentivise investment as effectively as countries with higher headline rates.

The result is less capital investment and lower productivity than countries like France and Germany.

We have already taken measures to address this.

For larger businesses we have had the super deduction, introduced by my RHF the Prime Minister, which ends this month.

For smaller businesses we have increased the Annual Investment Allowance to £1 million, meaning 99% of all businesses can deduct the full value of all their investment from that year’s taxable profits.

If the super deduction was allowed to end without a replacement, we would have fallen down the international league tables for tax competitiveness and damaged growth.

I could not allow that to happen.

So today, I can announce that we will introduce a new policy of “full expensing” for the next three years, with an intention to make it permanent as soon as we can responsibly do so.

That means that every single pound a company invests in IT equipment, plant or machinery can be deducted in full and immediately from taxable profits.

It is a corporation tax cut worth an average of £9 billion a year for every year it is in place.

And its impact on our economy will be huge. The OBR says it will increase business investment by 3% for every year it is in place.

This decision makes us the only major European country with full expensing…

…and gives us the joint most generous capital allowance regime of any advanced economy.

Madam Deputy Speaker, I also want to make our taxes more competitive in our life science and creative industry sectors.

In the Autumn, I said I would return with a more robust R & D tax credit scheme for smaller research-intensive companies.

So today, I am introducing an enhanced credit which means that if a qualifying small or medium-sized business spends 40% or more of their total expenditure on R & D, they will be able to claim a credit worth £27 for every £100 they spend.

That means an eligible cancer drug company spending £2 million on research and development will receive over £500,000 to help them develop breakthrough treatments.

It is a £1.8 billion package of support helping 20,000 cutting edge companies who day by day are turning Britain into a science superpower.

This government’s audio-visual tax reliefs have helped make our film and TV industry the biggest in Europe. Only last month, Pinewood announced an expansion which will bring another 8,000 jobs to the UK.

To give even more momentum to this critical sector I will introduce an expenditure credit with a rate of 34% for film, high end television and video games and 39% for the animation and children’s TV sectors. I will maintain the qualifying threshold for high-end television at £1 million.

And because our theatres, orchestras and museums do such a brilliant job at attracting tourists to London and the UK, I will also extend for another two years their current 45% and 50% reliefs.

Energy

Madam Deputy Speaker, an enterprise economy needs low taxes. But it also needs cheap and reliable energy.

We have already announced billions of support to help businesses reduce their energy bills through the Energy Bills Relief Scheme and the Energy Bills Discount Scheme.

We have appointed Dame Alison Rose, Chief Executive of NatWest, to co-Chair our national energy efficiency taskforce and help deliver our national ambition to reduce energy use by 15%.

To support her efforts, I will extend the Climate Change Agreement scheme for two years to allow eligible businesses £600 million of tax relief on energy efficiency measures.

But the long-term solution is not subsidy but security.

That means investing in domestic sources of energy that fall outside Putin or any autocrat’s control.

We are world leaders in renewable energy so today I want to develop another plank of our green economy, Carbon Capture Usage and Storage.

I am allocating up to £20 billion of support for the early development of CCUS, starting with projects from our East Coast to Merseyside to North Wales – paving the way for CCUS everywhere across the UK as we approach 2050.

This will support up to 50,000 jobs, attract private sector investment and help capture 20-30 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2030.

We have increased the proportion of electricity generated from renewables from under 10% to nearly 40%.

But because the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine, we will need another critical source of cheap and reliable energy.

And that is nuclear.

There have been no more powerful advocates for this than the hon members for Ynys Mon, Copeland, Hartlepool and Workington.

They rightly say that increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our Net Zero obligations.

So to encourage the private sector investment into our nuclear programme, I today confirm that subject to consultation nuclear power will be classed as “environmentally sustainable” in our green taxonomy, giving it access to the same investment incentives as renewable energy.

Alongside that will come more public investment.

In the Autumn Statement, I announced the first state-financed investment in nuclear for a generation, a £700 million investment in Sizewell C.

Today I can announce two further commitments to deliver our nuclear ambitions.

Firstly, following representations from our energetic Energy Security Secretary I am announcing the launch of Great British Nuclear which will bring down costs and provide opportunities across the nuclear supply chain to help provide up to one quarter of our electricity by 2050.

And secondly, I am launching the first competition for Small Modular Reactors. It will be completed by the end of this year and if demonstrated as viable we will co-fund this exciting new technology.

Boosting innovation

Finally under the ‘e’ of Enterprise I come to our innovation economy, a central area of national competitive advantage for the United Kingdom.

Over the weekend, I worked night and day with the Prime Minister and the Governor of the Bank of England to protect the deposits of thousands of our most cutting-edge companies.

We successfully secured the sale of the UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank to HSBC, so the future of those companies is now safe in the hands of one of Europe’s biggest and most creditworthy banks.

But those events show that we need to build a larger, more diverse financing system, where the benefits of investment in high growth firms are available to more investors.

So I will return in the Autumn Statement with a plan to deliver that. It will include measures to unlock productive investment from defined contribution pension funds and other sources, make the London Stock Exchange a more attractive place to list, and complete our response to the challenges created by the US Inflation Reduction Act.

However when it comes to our innovation industries, there are two areas I want to make progress on today.

Nigel Lawson made the City of London one of the world’s top financial centres by competitive deregulation.

With our Brexit autonomy, we can do the same for our high growth sectors.

So today I want to reform the regulations around medicines and medical technologies.

We are lucky with the MHRA to have one of the most respected drugs regulators in the world, indeed the very first to licence a Covid vaccine.

From 2024, they will move to a different model which will allow rapid, often near automatic sign-off for medicines and technologies already approved by trusted regulators in other parts of the world such as the United States, Europe or Japan.

At the same time from next year they will set up a swift new approval process for the most cutting-edge medicines and devices to ensure the UK becomes a global centre for their development.

And with an extra £10m of funding over the next two years they will put in place the quickest, simplest, regulatory approval in the world for companies seeking rapid market access.

We are proud of our life sciences sector which received more inward investment than any in Europe last year.

Today’s change will make the UK an even more exciting place to invest – as well as speeding up access for NHS patients to the very newest drugs.

Today together with our talented Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary, I also take measures to strengthen our position in artificial intelligence, where the UK hosts one third of all European companies.

I am accepting all nine of the digital technology recommendations made by Sir Patrick Vallance in the review I asked him to do in the Autumn Statement.

That means I can report to the House that we will:

…launch an AI sandbox to trial new, faster approaches to help innovators get cutting edge products to market;

…work at pace with the Intellectual Property Office to provide clarity on IP rules so Generative AI companies can access the material they need;

……and ask Sir Patrick’s successor, Dame Professor Angela McLean, to report before the summer on options around the Growth Duty for regulators.

Because AI needs computing horsepower, I today commit around £900m of funding to implement the recommendations in the independent Future of Compute Review for an Exascale supercomputer.

The power that AI’s complex algorithms need can also be provided by quantum computing.

So today we publish a quantum strategy which will set our vision to be a world leading quantum enabled economy by 2033 with a research and innovation programme totalling £2.5 billion.

I also want to encourage the best AI research to happen in the UK so will award a prize of £1m every year, for the next ten years, to the person or team that does the most ground-breaking British AI research.

The world’s first stored-programme computer was built at the University of Manchester in 1948, and was known as the “Manchester baby”.

75 years on, the baby has grown up, so I will call this new national AI award “the Manchester Prize” in its honour.

Madam Deputy Speaker we want the UK to be the best place in Europe for companies to locate, invest and grow so today’s enterprise measures strengthen our technology and life science sectors, invest in energy security and for three years - but I hope permanently - cut corporation tax by £9 billion a year to give us the best investment incentives of any advanced economy.

Employment

An enterprise economy can only grow if it can hire the people it needs, which brings me to my third pillar after ‘Everywhere’ and ‘Enterprise’, the ‘E’ of Employment.

Brexit was a decision by the British people to change our economic model.

In that historic vote, our country decided to move from a model based on unlimited low skill migration to one based on high wages and high skills.

Today we show how we will deliver that with a major set of reforms. The OBR say it is the biggest positive supply side intervention they have ever recognised in their forecast.

We have around one million vacancies in the economy…

… but excluding students there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work.

That is a potential pool of seven people for every vacancy. We believe work is a virtue.

We agree with the road haulage king Eddie Stobart who said: ‘the only place success comes before work is the dictionary.’

So today, I bring forward reforms to remove the barriers that stop people who want to from working. I start with over 2 million people who are inactive due to a disability or long-term sickness.

Long term sick and disabled

Thanks to the reforms courageously introduced by the Rt Hon Member for Chingford and Woodford Green, the number of disabled people in work has risen by two million since 2013.

But even after that we could fill half the vacancies in the economy with people who say they would like to work despite being inactive due to sickness or disability.

With Zoom, Teams and n"
,,
,,
 the ever-diligent Work and Pensions Secretary, today takes the next step in his ground-breaking work on tackling economic inactivity.,
,,
 and today we publish a White Paper on disability benefits reform.,,
,,
,,
,,
 disabled benefit claimants will always be able to seek work without fear of losing financial support.,,
,,
 after listening to representations from the Centre for Social Justice and others, we will fund a new programme called Universal Support.,
,,
 voluntary employment scheme for disabled people where the government will spend up to £4,000 per person to help them find appropriate jobs and put in place the support they need. It will fund 50,000 places every single year.
,,
,,
,,
 so I am also announcing a £400m plan to increase the availability of mental health and musculoskeletal resources and expand the Individual Placement and Support scheme.,,
,,
 I will also bring forward two new consultations on how to improve its availability and double the funding for the small company subsidy pilot.,,
,,
,,
,,
 which is children in care. They too should be given all possible help to make a normal working life possible when they reach adulthood.,,
,,
 they depend on foster families who do a brilliant job, so I am today nearly doubling the Qualifying Care Relief threshold to £18,140 which will give a tax cut to a qualifying carer worth an average of £450 a year.
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
 no civilised society can ignore the contribution that can be made by those with challenging family circumstances, a long-term illness or a disability.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
 more than enough to fill every single vacancy in the economy.,,
,,
 which is why we believe those who can work, should.,
,,
,,
,,
 we will increase the Administrative Earnings Threshold from the equivalent of 15 hours to 18 hours at National Living Wage for an individual claimant, meaning that anyone working below this level will receive more work coach support alongside a more intensive conditionality regime.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
 although as a 56-year-old myself I prefer the term “experienced.”,,
,,
 an increase of 320,000 since before the pandemic.,
,,
,,
,,
 we would add more than one million people to our national labour force.,,
,,
 I say this not to flatter you, but older people are the most skilled and experienced people we have.,
,,
,,
,,
 turning 50 is a moment of anxiety about the cliff edge of retirement rather than a moment of anticipation about another two decades of fulfilment.,,
,,
 I was relegated to the backbenches and planned for a quiet life. But instead I decided to set an example by embarking on a new career in finance.,,
,,
,,
,,
 we will increase the number of people who get the best possible financial, health and career guidance ahead of retirement by enhancing the DWP’s excellent “Mid-life MOT” Strategy.,
,,
000 to 40,000 a year.,
,,
 we will introduce a new kind of apprenticeship targeted at the over 50s who want to return to work.,,
,,
 and operate alongside skills boot camps and sector-based work academies.,,
,,
 focussing on flexibility and previous experience to reduce training length.,,
,,
 I have listened to the concerns of many senior NHS clinicians who say unpredictable pension tax charges are making them leave the NHS just when they are needed most.,,
,,
 and we will shortly publish the long-term workforce plan I promised in the Autumn Statement.,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
000 to £60,0,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
 taking thousands of people out of the complexity of pension tax.,,
,,
 a comprehensive plan to remove the barriers to work facing those on benefits, those with health conditions and older workers. That is the ‘e’ of the employment pillar of today’s growth budget.,
,,
,,
,,
 Enterprise and Everywhere I turn to the ‘e’ of Education.,,
,,
 this government has driven improvement in our education system.,,
,,
,,
,,
 I built on this progress with an extra £2.3bn annual investment to our schools.,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
 a career break becomes a career end.,,
,,
 but we trail top performers like Denmark and the Netherlands.,,
,,
 there would be more than one million additional women working.,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
 rising to £1,200 for those who join through an agency.,
,,
,,
,,
 with around two thirds of childcare providers increasing fees last year alone.,,
,,
,,
,,
 just as the sector has requested.,,
,,
 we will change minimum staff-to-child ratios from 1:4 to 1:5 for two-year-olds in England as happens in Scotland, although the new ratios will remain optional with no obligation on either childminders or parents to adopt them.,
,,
,,
,,
000 parents on universal credit who, until the reforms I announced today had limited requirements to look for work. Many remain out of work because they cannot afford the upfront payment necessary to access subsidised childcare.,
,,
 we will pay their childcare costs upfront.,,
,,
630 for two children, an increase of almost 50%.,
,,
,,
,,
 who often face barriers to working because of the limited availability of wraparound care.,,
,,
 even though for many people a job requires availability throughout the working day.,,
,,
 we will fund schools and local authorities to increase supply of wraparound care so all school-age parents can drop their children off between 8am and 6pm.,,
,,
 either on their own or in partnership with other schools, by September 2026.,
,,
,,
,,
 today’s childcare reforms will increase the availability of childcare, reduce costs and increase the number of parents able to use it.,
,,
 they amount to the most significant improvements to childcare provision in a decade.,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
 if they want to, because it is damaging to our economy and unfair, mainly to women.
,,
 we will introduce 30 hours of free childcare not just for 3-and-4 year-olds, but for every single child over the age of 9 months.,
,,
,,
,,
500 every year for a family with a two-year-old child using 35 hours of childcare every week…,,
,,
,,
,,
 we will introduce it in stages to ensure there is enough supply in the market.,,
,,
 helping around half a million parents.,,
,,
 that 15 hours will be extended to all children from 9 months up, meaning a total of nearly one million parents will be eligible.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
 the ‘E’ of education alongside the three other pillars of our growth plan, enterprise, employment and everywhere.
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
 more help.,,
,,
 barriers removed.,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
 30 hours of free childcare for all under 5s.,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
 and the optimists are right.,,
,,
,,
,,

  Part of government’s efforts to support most vulnerable households


A consultation has been launched today (Wednesday 31 August) to invite views from social housing tenants and landlords on a proposed rent cap to understand how best to support households with the cost of living.

Under the proposals, a cap on social housing rent increases would be put in place for the coming financial year, with options at 3%, 5% and 7% being considered.

The move would prevent rents for council and housing association houses from rising significantly, saving tenants an average £300 per year and providing stability as inflation rises.

The government regulates how much social housing rents can increase each year. Currently this is set at up to the consumer price index (CPI) rate plus 1% – meaning potential increases next year of 11% in line with recent Bank of England forecasts.

The proposed new cap will help support the most vulnerable households in the face of cost-of-living pressures. This comes on top of our existing £37 billion support package, which includes a £150 council tax rebate, a £400 energy bill discount to support households over the coming months and the most vulnerable 8 million households receiving support of at least £1,200.

Housing Secretary Greg Clark said:


  We must protect the most vulnerable households in these exceptional circumstances during the year ahead. Putting a cap on rent increases for social tenants offers security and stability to families across England.

  We know many people are worried about the months ahead. We want to hear from landlords and social tenants on how we can make this work and support the people that need it most.

  The rent cap would be temporary and would apply from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. The consultation also seeks views on whether to set a limit for 2024-25. The government understands this will impact social housing landlords and is engaging fully with the sector.


Following the consultation, a final decision will be announced later this year, to make sure social housing landlords have enough time to factor this into their rent decisions for April 2023.

The government is also committing to reviewing social rent policy beyond 2025, via a separate consultation due to be launched next year.

Today’s announcement is part of measures the government has put in place to support the most vulnerable households with the cost of living.

This is in addition to the £11.5 billion investment to build more affordable, quality homes through the Affordable Homes Programme.

Geeta Nanda OBE, Chair of the G15 group of leading housing associations and Chief Executive of MTVH, said:


  We are deeply concerned by the impact cost of living pressures are having on the people we provide homes to. G15 members have increased support for residents, including providing additional funding for vital crisis support, on top of the work we are doing to bring down people’s energy bills by improving the energy performance of the homes we provide. The support government has announced for energy bills is welcome, but it is clear that further assistance is urgently needed.

  All G15 members recognise the current high rates of inflation and are considering the impact of this on residents and the essential work we do carefully. To maintain and improve existing residents’ homes, as well as continuing to build much needed new affordable homes, significant investment each year is essential. Rental income is critical to supporting this work. Housing associations have already seen costs for vital materials for repairs and maintenance work increase by as much as 16.8% this year, and the cost of constructing new homes has grown by more than 11% as well.

  In getting the balance right on rent setting, we are committed to maintaining affordability for residents. We welcome the government’s consultation and the opportunity to discuss these important issues further.

16/01/2023,Sky is the first national provider to help their customers access cheaper broadband by signing up to the Department for Work and Pensions scheme for benefit claimants.,"
    
          
    Sky is the first major connectivity provider to join DWP initiative making it easier for benefits claimants to get discounted broadband and mobile tariffs
  
  
    Automatic verification means claimants do not have to repeatedly prove their benefit claim status to access discounted social tariffs
  
  
    Switching to a social tariff could save claimants up to £180 a year
  
This system makes it easier than ever for low-income families to sign up to discounted broadband which could save households as much as £180 a year compared to industry average tariffs.

Introduced last summer, the government scheme lets internet service providers – with claimants’ permission – ask the DWP to automatically verify their customers’ benefit entitlement.

This means people do not need to actively prove they claim benefits whilst on a tariff designed for those on low incomes, as they did previously, often as frequently as every month.

Minister for Social Mobility, Youth and Progression Mims Davies said:


  It’s positive to see a major provider, such as Sky, sign up to our scheme, making it easier for families to access cheaper broadband and mobile tariffs in difficult times, and I call on other providers to follow suit in offering this type of tariff for those in need.

  Claimants who think they might be eligible for one of these tariffs, should contact their provider.

  This is just one of the ways we are working to help households during these tough times as part of the government’s £37 billion support package for those most in need. Do use the DWP benefits calculator, which is a helpful tool for those looking to see if they could access wider support.



Stephen van Rooyen, Executive Vice President & Chief Executive Officer, Sky, UK & Europe, said:


  We know how important connectivity is to our customers, which is why we are focussed on ways we can support them to say online. As well as support with bills, we also provide existing, eligible customers with a broadband and mobile social tariff, helping them stay connected for a significantly reduced cost. The Department for Work and Pensions eligibility tool is a useful step forward, enabling us to more easily confirm eligibility.


Sky and its subsidiary brand NOW join a growing list of providers signing up to the government initiative to help millions access cut price broadband, with WightFibre already signed up to the scheme.

Before the new system was introduced, people were regularly required to verify their entitlement to providers with Jobcentre letters or screenshots of their Universal Credit account.

The availability of social tariffs has been strengthened recently thanks to a drive by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to encourage telecommunicators to expand their range of cheaper deals.

Broadband social tariff take-up more than doubled in 2022 to 136,000 households and the cross-government Help for Households programme, which aims to help people with the increased cost of living, recently launched a UK-wide public awareness campaign to drive awareness and uptake further.

Those in receipt of benefits interested in exploring broadband tariff options should visit Ofcom’s website to view the full list of options on offer from providers.

15/05/2022,Cost of NHS prescriptions will be frozen for the first time in over a decade. ,"
    
          
Freeze will help ease the cost of living pressures on households, saving £17 million overall
  Comes alongside record government NHS investment to tackle the COVID-19 backlog and reduce waiting times
NHS prescription charges will be frozen for the first time in 12 years to help with the cost of living.

Charges usually increase in line with average inflation. This year – in a move not seen for over a decade – the cost for prescriptions will remain the same to help ease cost of living pressures and ensure prescription medication remains accessible.

This means people in England who pay prescription charges are saving £17 million overall. Charges for prescriptions will remain at £9.35 for a single charge or £30.25 for a 3-month prescription prepayment certificate (PPC).

12-month PPCs will remain at £108.10 and can be paid for in instalments, meaning people can get all the medicines they need for just over £2 a week.

In addition to the freeze on charges, the NHS low income scheme offers help with prescription payments, with free prescriptions for eligible people in certain groups such as pensioners, students, and those who receive state benefits or live in care homes.

Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said:


  The rise in the cost of living has been unavoidable as we face global challenges and the repercussions of Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine. While we cannot completely prevent these rises, where we can help, we absolutely will.

  This is why I am freezing prescription charges to help ease some of these pressures and put money back in people’s pockets.


The government and NHS is working to tackle the COVID-19 backlogs while reforming routine care services, ending long waits and improving patient care. The pandemic has put huge pressure on health and care services and over the next 3 years, a record £39 billion will be invested through the Health and Care Levy, so the NHS has the funding it needs. The NHS is opening new surgical hubs and 160 community diagnostic centres so patients have easier access to tests closer to home – with 88 already open, delivering over 800,000 scans.

In addition, the Health and Care Bill received Royal Assent last month, enacting the most significant health legislation in a decade into law. It marks an important step in the government’s ambitious health and care agenda, setting up systems and structures to reform how health and adult social care work together, tackle long waiting lists built up during the pandemic, and address some of the long-term challenges faced by the country including a growing and ageing population, chronic conditions and inequalities in health outcomes.

The government is listening to people’s concerns and targeting support at the lowest paid in society, with measures worth over £22 billion in 2022 to 2023 to help with the cost of energy bills and to ensure people keep more of their money. This includes raising the threshold at which people start to pay National Insurance to £12,570, providing a £330 a year tax cut to 30 million workers in July. The National Living Wage has risen to £9.50 per hour – an extra £1,000 a year for a full-time worker, and taxes have been cut for the lowest paid workers on Universal Credit – so they can keep more of what they earn.

The prescription freeze will also apply to NHS wigs and fabric supports. These prices will remain at current levels:

surgical bra £30.70
  abdominal or spinal support £46.30
  stock modacrylic wig £75.70
  partial human hair wig £200.50
  full bespoke human hair wig £293.20
You are exempt from charges if you:

are 60 or over
  are under 16
  are 16 to 18 and in full-time education
  are pregnant or have had a baby in the previous 12 months and have a valid maternity exemption certificate (MatEx)
  have a specified medical condition and have a valid medical exemption certificate (MedEx)
  have a continuing physical disability that prevents you going out without help from another person and have a valid medical exemption certificate (MedEx)

23/11/2022,"Government is stepping in to provide pensioners with £300 per household, which comes on top of regular Winter Fuel Payments.","
    
          From today, over 11.6 million pensioners will start to receive up to £600 to help with their energy bills this winter, as prices are pushed up by Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine.
  This support, worth over £4.5 billion, is part of an extensive package helping people of all ages with the cost of heating their homes, including through the £400 Energy Bills Support Scheme [available to eligible households in England, Scotland and Wales], and the Energy Price Guarantee saving typical households £900.
From today (23 November 2022), over 11.6 million pensioners in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will start to receive payments of up to £600 to help with their energy bills this winter.

Winter Fuel Payments – boosted this year by an additional £300 per household Pensioner Cost of Living payment – will land in bank accounts over the next two months, the vast majority automatically.

Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said:


  We want to do everything we can to support pensioners who are often the most exposed to higher costs. That’s why we’re providing all pensioner households with an additional £300 on top of their Winter Fuel Payments to heat their homes and stay warm this winter.



  This extra payment is just one part of the wider support package we’re delivering to help with rising bills, including the biggest State Pension increase in history.



  Our support doesn’t stop here. As we deal with the impact of Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine and the aftermath of the pandemic, we will continue to stand by the most vulnerable, with further cost of living payments coming next year.


The money will appear in bank statements with the payment reference starting with the customer’s national Insurance number followed by ‘DWP WFP’ for people in Great Britain, or ‘DFC WFP’ for people in Northern Ireland.

The overwhelming majority of Winter Fuel Payments are paid automatically but some people need to make a claim, such as those who qualify but do not receive benefits or the State Pension and have never previously received a Winter Fuel Payment.

This month, over seven million payments of £324 have already been made to low-income households as part of this government’s cost of living support. This includes pensioners receiving Pension Credit.

The average Pension Credit award is worth over £3,500 a year, and for those pensioners who may be eligible but are yet to make an application, there is still time to do so and qualify for this additional £324 payment.

This is because Pension Credit claims can be backdated by up to three months, provided the entitlement conditions are met throughout that time.

To ensure that a successful backdated claim falls within the qualifying period for extra £324 cost of living help, pensioners are being urged to claim Pension Credit as soon as possible, and by no later than 18 December 2022.

The online Pension Credit calculator is on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

Further cost of living support to be paid next year was announced by the Chancellor in his Autumn Statement last week. Payments will include a further £300 for pensioners, £900 for households on means-tested benefits and £150 for those on disability benefits.

23/03/2022,The Chancellor delivered a Spring Statement today (23 March) that puts billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working people in Scotland – unveiling a series of tax cuts to ease the cost of living.,"
    
          

    Chancellor announces Spring Statement tax cut for 2.4 million Scottish workers through rise in National Insurance thresholds – saving the typical employee over £330 a year
  
  
    Unveiling plans to give families further help with the cost of living, Rishi Sunak also slashes fuel duty on petrol and diesel by 5p per litre for the next 12 months
  
  
    Spring Statement also sets out measures to help businesses boost investment, innovation, and growth – including a £1,000 increase to Employment Allowance to benefit around half a million SMEs across the UK
  
  
    The UK Government is providing an additional £45 million to the Scottish Government next year as a result of measures announced by the Chancellor today.
  
Rishi Sunak announced that National Insurance starting thresholds will rise to £12,570 from July, meaning hard-working people across the UK will keep more of what they earn before they start paying personal taxes.

The cut, worth over £6 billion, will benefit 2.4 million working people in Scotland with a typical employee saving over £330 a year, whilst the typical self-employed person will save over £250. This means the UK now has some of the most generous tax thresholds in the world.

Mr Sunak also announced that fuel duty for petrol and diesel will be cut by 5p per litre from 6pm tonight (23 March) to help drivers across the UK with rising costs. Worth £2.4 billion, this is the biggest cut ever on all fuel duty rates and means a one-car family will now save on average £100.

As a result of a cut to the basic rate of income tax for savings income, taxpayers in Scotland will see benefits worth £3 million. As other income tax rates are devolved in Scotland, the Scottish Government’s funding is automatically increased as a result of this tax cut as set out in the agreed Fiscal Framework. This is initially worth £350 million in 2024-25.

The Chancellor also set out a series of measures to help businesses boost investment, innovation, and growth – including a £1,000 increase to Employment Allowance to benefit around half a million businesses.

As a result of measures in this Spring Statement the UK Government is providing the Scottish Government with an additional £45 million through the Barnett formula next year.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said:


  We’re slashing taxes for millions of hard-working people in Scotland, getting pounds in people’s pockets and helping pay cheques to stretch further – from July more than 2.4 million in Scotland will get a tax cut with the typical employee keeping £330 more each year.

  By cutting fuel duty, we’re making it cheaper for people in Scotland every time they go to the pump, which together with the freeze means people save £100 per car on average a year.

  We’re boosting small business growth by increasing the Employment Allowance – a tax cut worth up to £1,000 for thousands of businesses.


Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said:


  Measures announced by the Chancellor will help address the big issues facing people in Scotland and right across the UK.

  Families across the country are struggling with the cost of living. The reduction in fuel duty, zero VAT on green home improvements, and a tax cut for low and middle earners will help them with these growing pressures.

  And an extra £45 million for the Scottish Government will allow them to provide additional support to the most vulnerable families over the coming months.

  The Chancellor also reiterated our steadfast support for the people of Ukraine. I know people across Scotland will stand with him on that.

  These are undoubtably challenging times, but action taken by the Chancellor in the Spring Statement will help the UK Government build a stronger, more secure economy for everyone.


To grow the world’s very best talent in AI, the Government will partner with industry and academia to create 1,000 new AI PhDs. The Government will invest £117m to create PHDs across the UK at Centres for Doctoral Training, building on the existing three sites in Scotland. This will train a new generation of AI researchers who will develop and use AI in areas such as healthcare, climate change and creating new commercial opportunities.

Delivering the statement, the Chancellor made clear that our sanctions against Russia will not be cost-free for people at home, and that Putin’s invasion presents a risk to our economic recovery – as it does to countries all around the world.

However, announcing the further measures to help people deal with rising costs, he said the extra support could only be provided because of the UK’s strong economy and the tough but responsible decisions taken to rebuild our fiscal resilience.

The immediate financial support for people and businesses comes as part of a wider tax plan announced by the Chancellor that will create better conditions for growth and will share proceeds from growth more fairly – ensuring people can keep more of what they earn.

Mr Sunak also announced that the Scottish Government will receive £41 million more funding as there will be an extra £500 million for the Household Support Fund, which doubles it’s total amount to £1 billion to support the most vulnerable families with their essentials over the coming months. The Chancellor also reduced the VAT on energy saving materials such as solar panels, heating pumps and roof insulation from 5% to zero, helping families become more energy-efficient.

This cost of living support comes on top of the measures that the Chancellor has already announced over the recent months to support families. This includes an over £9 billion energy bill rebate package, worth up to £350 each for around 28 million households, an increase to the National Living Wage, worth £1,000 for full time workers, and a cut to the Universal Credit taper, worth £1,000 for 2 million families.

Further announcements

The Spring Statement also confirms that:


    A new Efficiency and Value for Money Committee will be set up to cut £5.5 billion worth of cross-Whitehall waste – with savings to be used to fund public services.
  
  
    £50 million new funding to create a Public Sector Fraud Authority to hold departments to account for their counter-fraud performance and to help them identify, seize and recover fraudsters money.
  
  
    Local residents across the UK will benefit from a fresh set of infrastructure projects as we open the second round of the £4.8 billion Levelling Up Fund. It will continue to focus on regeneration, transport and cultural investments.

31/01/2023,"The CMA is today starting a programme of work looking into unit pricing practices online and instore in the groceries sector.  Unit pricing shows how much a particular product costs by weight or volume, which helps people identify best value for money.","
    
          In the context of the rising cost of living, people shopping for food and other essential products need confidence that they have the right information to make great choices and are getting fair deals. It is important that shoppers who look at the prices of products should be able to compare like for like.  This, together with recent concerns raised by stakeholders, has led the CMA to revisit the issue of unit pricing.

This new work follows the 2015 Groceries Super-complaint where the CMA considered pricing and promotional practices in the groceries market and concluded that complexities and inconsistencies with unit pricing may prevent people from spotting which deal gives them the best value.

These included:

different interpretations of legibility of unit prices amongst retailers
  inconsistencies with how retailers present unit prices for similar products
  inconsistencies with how retailers present unit prices for products on promotion
George Lusty, Senior Director for Consumer Protection at the CMA said:


  We know that the increased cost of living has hit the pound in people’s pockets.

  That’s why we’re pressing on with this important grocery unit pricing work to ensure shoppers can more easily compare prices and make choices that are right for them.


The project will consider the following:

if the unit pricing issues identified during the 2015 Super-complaint remain
  compliance with the law by retailers
  consumer awareness and use of unit pricing information
The project is at an early stage and the CMA has not formed a view on these issues. The CMA will provide an update on the case page later in 2023.

Sue Davies, Which? Head of Food Policy, said:


  Grocery prices are a huge concern as households all over the country grapple with the cost of living crisis, so it’s timely and important for the CMA to be looking at whether prices are clearly and fairly displayed at the supermarket.

  We know poor, inconsistent and sometimes missing price information is a problem and that’s why Which? is campaigning for pricing transparency from supermarkets, so that shoppers can easily work out which products are the best value.


The project forms part of the CMA’s work to help people, businesses and the UK economy by promoting competitive markets and tackling unfair behaviour outlined in the recent 2023/24 draft Annual Plan.

29/07/2022,"More than 8.9 million grants have been given to families to help with post-pandemic pressures through a fund set up to help the most vulnerable, new figures reveal.","
    
          8.9 million grants given to families in first round of Household Support Fund, new data shows
  Local Authorities use government funding to help communities with innovative measures
  It “has been an important intervention to provide Help for Households”, minister says
The vital support was given to families in England from the Household Support Fund in the first six months of its introduction, with £400 million spent in support and given directly to those in need.

The Fund has since been extended to the end of March 2023 after receiving another £842 million in funding through two extensions.

Local Authorities administer the fund on behalf of the government to help vulnerable households across the country access support to help with the rising costs of energy, food, water and other related essentials.

Department for Work and Pensions Minister for Welfare Delivery, David Rutley said:


  The Household Support Fund has been an important intervention to provide Help for Households facing challenges with the cost of living.

  Local Authorities know what support works best in their areas. It has been good to see the different ways they have used the Fund to enrich the lives of people in their communities.

  With the extensions announced, Local Authorities can now provide that vital support through Christmas and beyond.


The latest figures show how the first round of the Fund was used from October 2021 to March 2022. Almost nine million instances of support were given to families who need it most across England.

Those in need of support were told to apply for, or directly received, the help through their local authority, and councils were empowered to use the Fund to support their communities in a way tailored to their needs. It’s clear from the latest data that many around the country have found the Fund useful.

In Leicestershire, the local authority partnered with Leicester City Football Club to put on community cooking events, providing nutritious meals for families while also improving their cooking skills to prepare healthy meals at home. In Darlington, the council worked with local organisations to give families end-of-day supermarket goods at a fraction of their usual cost.

London’s Lambeth Council has used some of its allocation to help fund its Healthy Living Platform food boxes for harder to reach communities, while Rochdale set up a community warehouse that distributed over 700 winter packs with blankets and sanitary products.

To access the latest round of funding available people should contact their upper tier local authority and ask what help is available through the Household Support Fund in their area.

By the end of March 2023, £1.262 billion in additional support will have been given out in England to help people with rising costs. Devolved governments will have received a total of £238 million through the Barnett Formula.

28/01/2021,Responsible tenants in England with well-behaved pets will be able to secure leases more easily through a new standard tenancy agreement.,"
    
          

New standard tenancy agreement makes it easier for tenants with pets to find rented accommodation
  Landlords using the revised Model Tenancy Agreement encouraged to no longer issue a blanket ban on pets
  Just 7% of private landlords currently advertise pet friendly properties


Responsible tenants with well-behaved pets will be able to secure leases more easily through the new Model Tenancy Agreement announced by the government today (28 January 2021).

Under the new Model Tenancy Agreement, announced by Housing Minister Rt Hon Christopher Pincher MP, landlords will no longer be able to issue blanket bans on pets by default.

Instead, consent for pets will be the default position, and landlords will have to object in writing within 28 days of a written pet request from a tenant and provide a good reason.

Currently, just 7% of private landlords advertise pet friendly properties, meaning many people struggle to find suitable homes. In some cases, this has meant people have had to give up their pets all together.

The Model Tenancy Agreement is the government’s recommended contract for landlords. With figures showing that more than half of adults in the United Kingdom own a pet and many more welcoming pets into their lives during the pandemic, these changes mean more landlords will cater for responsible pet owners.

Under the new agreement, rejections should only be made where there is good reason, such as in smaller properties or flats where owning a pet could be impractical.  To ensure landlords are protected, tenants will continue to have a legal duty to repair or cover the cost of any damage to the property.

Housing Minister Rt Hon Christopher Pincher MP said:


  We are a nation of animal lovers and over the last year more people than ever before have welcome pets into their lives and homes.

  But it can’t be right that only a tiny fraction of landlords advertise pet friendly properties and in some cases people have had to give up their beloved pets in order to find somewhere to live.

  For those who choose to use the revised Model Tenancy Agreement, we are bringing an end to the unfair default blanket ban on pets introduced by some landlords. This strikes the right balance between helping more people find a home that’s right for them and their pet while ensuring landlords’ properties are safeguarded against inappropriate or badly behaved pets.

27/05/2022,"Over 347,000 unemployed people on benefits have found work in just four months through the government’s Way to Work campaign – an ambitious national push to get half a million more people into jobs by the end of June.","
    
          new figures show 347,000 people have moved into work since January – thanks to a government-backed drive to fill vacancies
  with one month to go until the campaign ends, the government is calling on UK employers to join forces with Jobcentres to help more people find work
  alongside vital job support to lift incomes, the new £15 billion package to help with the cost of living will help millions of households
Today the Prime Minister and Work and Pensions Secretary urged employers of all sizes to use the free recruitment support from their local Jobcentre to help fill the record number of vacancies in the jobs market and support the continued economic recovery by getting people into work.

Since January, DWP jobcentres across the UK have been ramping up operations with weekly jobs fairs – bringing employers in for face-to-face appointments and offering jobs on the spot to thousands of people.

Jobseekers walking away with roles have also secured an income, with those getting full time work set to be thousands of pounds better off than if they were on benefits. Helping households improve their finances and manage current cost of living pressures is a key priority for the government, with a £15 billion package announced yesterday to support almost all of the eight million most vulnerable households across the UK.

Today in the North East of England, the Prime Minister and Work and Pensions Secretary visited CityFibre, a new employer to the Way to Work campaign who have already benefitted from 200 new recruits from around the UK, hired through their local Jobcentres. During the visit, they also met local employees who have secured skilled jobs as a result of the campaign and the support of their local Jobcentre.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

“I was only ten years old when unemployment was last this low.

“But with a vast number of vacancies in the jobs market, it is more critical than ever to access the huge pool of untapped talent in towns and cities right across the country, which is why I am thrilled with the progress we have made with the Way to Work scheme.”

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Thérèse Coffey said:


  Unemployment is at its lowest since the 1970s with full time workers across the UK £6000 better off than if they were on benefits.

  And there are still vacancies to fill. That’s why our jobcentres are helping employers short circuit the recruitment process so they can get talent in fast.

  So, if you’re hiring, make the most of the help on offer from us.


Greg Mesch, Chief Executive at CityFibre said:


  CityFibre is rolling out the UK’s finest digital infrastructure to millions of homes and businesses nationwide. To build these new Full Fibre networks, we’re creating thousands of new network construction  jobs and providing industry training to those that need it.

  We and our construction partners are working closely with DWP nationally, and local Jobcentres, by engaging with schemes like Way to Work. We look forward to increasing our involvement in the future.


Alongside vital job support to help jobseekers secure an income, the new £15 billion cost of living support package will help almost all of the eight million most vulnerable households across the UK as they are set to receive help of at least £1,200 this year, including a new one-off £650 cost of living payment.

The government has also announced a £500 million increase for the Household Support Fund, delivered by local authorities, extending it to March 2023. This brings the total Household Support Fund to £1.5 billion.

28/08/2019,"The Prime Minister has announced plans to bring forward a new bold and ambitious legislative agenda: helping the NHS, fighting violent crime, investing in infrastructure and science and cutting the cost of living.","
    
          
The Prime Minister has briefed Cabinet colleagues that the government will bring forward an ambitious new legislative programme for MPs’ approval, and that the current parliamentary session will be brought to an end.

The Prime Minister has spoken to Her Majesty The Queen to request an end to the current parliamentary session in the second sitting week in September. Following the conclusion of the traditional party conference season, the second session of this Parliament will commence with a Queen’s Speech on Monday 14 October.

A central feature of the legislative programme will be the Government’s number one legislative priority - if a new deal is forthcoming at European Council - to introduce a Withdrawal Agreement Bill and move at pace to secure its passage before 31 October.

The decision to end the current parliamentary session - the longest in close to 400 years and in recent months one of the least active - will enable the Prime Minister to put a fresh domestic programme in front of MPs for debate and scrutiny while also ensuring that there is good time before and after the European Council for Parliament to further consider Brexit issues. Votes on the Queen’s Speech are likely to fall on Monday 21 and Tuesday 22 October.

Through a Queen’s Speech, the government will seek to strengthen public services, improve infrastructure and connectivity across the country, tackle crime and enhance the integrity of the criminal justice system, while protecting our natural environment for the long-term.

The Prime Minister said:


  We must focus on crucial public priorities - helping the NHS, fighting violent crime, investing in infrastructure and science and cutting the cost of living.

  We have made an important start – funding for 20,000 extra police officers and new investment in our NHS – but to deliver on the public’s priorities we require a new session and a Queen’s Speech.

  I believe it is vital that Parliament is sitting both before and after European Council and if, as I hope, a deal with the EU is forthcoming, Parliament will then have the opportunity to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill required for ratification ahead of 31 October.

13/04/2022,"Abused women, drug addicts and offenders serving short sentences will be supported to turn their lives away from crime, as the Government backs specialist schemes aimed at criminals more likely to reoffend.","
    
          

Specialist schemes targeting criminals likely to reoffend backed by Government funding
  Focus on care leavers, drug addicts, abused women and short-sentence offenders
  Projects will tackle drivers of crime – such as unemployment, addiction and homelessness – and help to cut £18bn cost of reoffending


Today, the Government has confirmed it will support a further 11 projects through the Prison Leavers Project - a £20 million cross-government initiative helping offenders move on from their life of crime once they are released from jail.

With reoffending costing the taxpayer £18 billion and around 80 percent of offenders having at least one previous caution or conviction, the Government is committed to giving offenders a second chance to make a positive contribution to society and cut crime.

All the projects set to benefit from the almost £7 million pot tackle key drivers of offending – including addiction, unemployment, housing problems and social isolation. Statistics prove that offenders who are released from prison with nowhere to live are around 50 percent more likely to break the law again. While those have a job within 12 months of release, are up to nine percentage points less likely to reoffend.

The 11 pilot projects include:

A scheme in London specifically for offenders on short sentences which provides employment training and helps re-establish broken family ties
  A peer-mentoring project in the West Midlands providing mental health support and guidance on housing and finance for men who have grown up in care
  Creating realistic work environments in prisons in the North West, with the help of local employers, to boost job prospects once offenders leave
  Specialist support for female offenders with a history of abuse, in Wales and the South-West, to help them settle back into the community
Crime, Policing and Probation Minister Kit Malthouse said:


  These schemes cut straight to the heart of the reasons for reoffending – allowing us to find new and innovative ways to keep some of the hardest-to-reform criminals on the straight and narrow.



  We know that having a job on release, a safe place to stay as well as supportive family and friends are some of the vital ingredients for a crime-free life.



  Our pilots will provide support and hope, while helping us to reduce the £18 billion cost of repeat crime and better protect the public.


One London-based project benefitting from the £6.7million of government funding will help those on serial short sentences to go straight. Prison-leaver charity Bounce Back provides job opportunities – training offenders in their painting and decorating academy – and re-establishes broken but vital family ties so they have the support they need to turn their lives around.

In the West Midlands, charity Change, Grow, Live is helping offenders who have grown up in the care system to live crime-free lives through peer-mentoring and support with housing and employment coaching. Former offender Ian Thomas is one of the mentors for the project who is inspiring others after leaving his life of crime, drugs and homelessness to return to university and become a qualified Social Worker.

Ian Thomas, social worker, Change Grow Live project in the West Midlands said:


  I’ve experienced first-hand how leaving care without proper support can lead to a life of crime, addiction and homelessness.



  Thousands of prisoners have been in the care system, which shows need for projects like Change Grow Live in the West Midlands, which is driving real change among hard-to-reach groups.



  If we give prison leavers the support network they desperately need, we can reduce reoffending and give them the opportunity to thrive in the community.


In the North-West, New Futures Network and charity Antz Junction are working with local employers to tackle skills shortages in the construction and haulage industries. Offenders in HMPs Lancaster Farms, Kirkham, Liverpool, Thorn Cross will be trained-up in prison with the prospects of leaving for real jobs and crime-free lives.

While in Wales and the South-West, the funding will help addiction charity the Nelson Trust target female offending, which is often driven by domestic abuse. Around 400 female offenders with a history of trauma and abuse will be supported through women’s centres to settle back into community life. The pilot will offer access to housing and substance misuse support as well as facilitating contact between mothers and their children.

29/04/2022,The CMA has published its second assessment of how well competition is working in the UK and what that means for people and businesses.,"
    
          Effective competition helps make sure shoppers and households get a fair deal when buying goods and services. This is especially important at a time when the UK is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and facing a rising cost of living.

Recognising the importance of competition, the Chancellor and the Business Secretary asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to assess the state of competition in the UK economy.

This is the second report of its kind that the CMA has produced.

Building on its first report, the CMA has improved the techniques it uses to measure indicators of competition like market concentration, firms’ profitability and markups, and market entry and exit levels.

Key findings include:

The level to which markets are dominated by a limited number of companies - their concentration - remains higher than it was before the financial crisis of 2008.
  Concentration is higher when ‘common ownership’, where competing firms are owned by the same companies, is factored in but lower when accounting for international trade.
  Lower income households are more likely to consume goods and services produced in more concentrated markets. This is because a higher proportion of their income is spent on essential services, like gas and water, which tend to be produced by a limited number of companies.
  Average markups - the amount added to the cost price of goods to cover overheads and profit - have increased since 2008, from just over 20% to about 35%, with the increase in markup being higher for the 10% most profitable firms.
  Evidence suggests that the largest and most profitable firms are able to sustain their strong position for longer than they used to, with the likelihood of the largest firms in an industry remaining the largest firms increasing over the last 20 years.
  Digital markets have huge potential to improve our lives and living standards and to play an important role in the post-pandemic recovery. But to deliver those benefits, they need to stay competitive. Weak competition in digital markets, like search engines, mobile ecosystems and social media, risks reducing innovation and choice, and leading to people giving up more personal data than they would like.
In its report, the CMA also analyses surveys which asked people about their direct experience of problems with goods and services they purchased. The BEIS Consumer Protection Study 2022 estimates that issues with purchased goods and services cost UK consumers £54.2 billion in the year to April 2021, with two-fifths of issues arising from just four sectors: renting services, vehicle maintenance and repair, second-hand vehicles, and internet provision. Consumers reported that around £7.7 billion of this cost (14% of the total) was caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The pandemic was also felt to have played a large part in the majority of issues people experienced with services provided by airlines and package holidays and tours sectors.

Mike Walker, Chief Economic Adviser at the CMA, said:


  Our State of Competition report shows a worrying combination of trends. We are seeing markets getting more concentrated, companies enjoying higher mark-ups and the biggest firms maintaining their leading positions for longer. The fact that all these indicators are pointing in the same direction provides a warning sign about the state of competition in the UK.

  What’s more, we’ve found that the poorest households are likely to suffer the effects of these changes the most - at the very time when they are already being hit by sharp rises in the cost of essential items.

  We will use our findings to direct our work to keep markets competitive and protect consumers at this crucial time.


The CMA’s report is informed by its knowledge of markets and work enforcing consumer and competition law. It has also included insights of outside experts, academic advisors and other parts of government.

23/09/2019,"Government commits to funding healthcare for over 180,000 UK nationals living in the EU for 6 months following Brexit if we leave without a deal.","
    
          People already living in the EU who have their healthcare funded by the UK, including pensioners and students, will have their healthcare costs covered for 6 months if we leave without a deal.

The government has proposed to each EU member state that, if we leave without a deal, existing healthcare arrangements continue until 31 December 2020 in the same way that they do now.

Discussions are ongoing but if arrangements with all member states have not been finalised by 31 October, Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock has today confirmed the government will provide support to around 180,000 UK nationals living in the EU who currently have their healthcare costs paid for by the UK for a 6-month period following exit day. This includes pensioners, students, those on disability benefits and UK workers temporarily posted in the EU.

The government has also committed to covering the costs of UK nationals in the EU who are in the middle of treatment when we leave the EU, for up to a year.

The government will also provide cover during the time it takes to be registered with a local healthcare scheme. This is to ensure people are not exposed to gaps in healthcare coverage and potentially high costs while they register for healthcare locally. To be eligible for this support, people must apply within local timeframes or no later than 6 months after we leave, whichever is the shortest.

The NHS is writing to 180,000 UK nationals living in the EU to make them aware of the information they need in the country they live in:


  Letter to S1 holders on access to healthcare after Brexit  (PDF, 223 KB, 2 pages)
The value of the commitment will ultimately depend on which EU countries accept the government’s offer. Modelling has been performed to assess the likely costs of the policy if it is required. This suggests the maximum expenditure the government would expect to make under this commitment if no further bilateral agreements are finalised may be in the region of £50 million in 2019 to 2020 and £100 million in 2020 to 2021 but could be significantly lower.

In addition to this, the government has committed to:

cover the healthcare costs for students who began their courses in the EU ahead of 31 October for the duration of their course
  cover the healthcare costs of UK visitors to the EU who commenced their trip before the UK left the EU until they return to the UK
  ensure that people currently insured by the UK living in the EU can return to use the NHS temporarily in England, Wales and Scotland free of charge
British citizens living in Ireland will be able to access healthcare in Ireland in the same way as before Brexit.

The UK and Spain have each taken steps to ensure that people living in each country can continue to access healthcare as they do now until at least 31 December 2020. This means that your healthcare access will remain the same after 31 October 2019, whatever the Brexit scenario.

See the NHS travelling and living abroad guides for the latest information on individual countries.

People should not delay taking action to put appropriate permanent arrangements in place for after exit day, particularly as for some EU countries the timeframe for UK nationals to register with their domestic health system is far shorter than 6 months.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:



  Protecting the healthcare rights of UK nationals is a priority of this government.

  While the government continues to work towards a good deal, I am today announcing that pensioners, students and UK workers living in the EU will have their healthcare costs covered for 6 months after 31 October, whatever the circumstances of Brexit.

  All UK nationals in the EU should act now and take the simple steps needed to secure their access to healthcare.


Her Majesty’s Ambassador to the Czech Republic, Nick Archer, said:


  We are pleased to confirm this additional support, which has been offered to pensioners and others who have their healthcare covered by the UK.

  These transitional arrangements provide welcome reassurance to thousands of our UK residents living in Europe who may have their access to healthcare affected after Brexit.

13/03/2023,The Access to Justice Foundation has been awarded funding to administer the ‘Improving Outcomes Through Legal Support’ grant.,"
    
          The grant will help thousands more people get access to early legal help after the government announced £12 million of new grant funding in November 2022.

This new grant will run from July 2023 until March 2025, with a greater emphasis on the provision of at court support and building an evidence base through robust data collection. The Access to Justice Foundation has published details on how to apply.

The funding will be awarded to charities providing advice and support to people with legal problems– helping them to better understand their issues and avoid costly court proceedings. This will help to ensure that for those cases where court or tribunal proceedings are necessary, people have the support they need to navigate the process effectively.

This funding adds to more than £5 million of investment from MOJ in this financial year, including a £1 million cost-of-living grant, to help organisations respond to increasing demand for free legal advice. Specialist guidance is offered in person, by telephone or online, to help deal with problems before they escalate or to support those who need to appear in court.

The current Help Accessing Legal Support grant worth £4.8 million will conclude in June 2023.

The Access to Justice Foundation has now launched the application process to award funding to organisations that will directly offer guidance and support.  The closing date for applications is 4pm on Friday 5 May 2023.

28/04/2022,The Government has concluded that it would be wrong to impose new administrative requirements on businesses who may pass-on the associated costs to consumers.,"
    
          
The remaining import controls on EU goods will no longer be introduced this year, the government has announced today.

Instead, traders will continue to move their goods from the European Union to Great Britain  as they do now.

Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, and the recent rise in global energy costs, have had a significant effect on supply chains that are still recovering from the pandemic.

The government has therefore concluded that it would be wrong to impose new administrative requirements on businesses who may pass-on the associated costs to consumers already facing pressures on their finances.

The change in approach is expected to save British importers at least £1 billion in annual costs.

The Government will now review how to implement these remaining controls in an improved way. The new Target Operating Model will be based on a better assessment of risk and will harness the power of data and technology. It will be published in the Autumn and the new controls regime will come into force at the end of 2023.

This process will build on existing work already taking place as part of the 2025 Border Strategy, including on the UK Single Trade Window – a new digital platform that will help traders to more easily move goods globally. Our goal is to create a seamless new ‘digital’ border, where technologies and real-time data will cut queues and smooth trade.

The controls introduced in January 2021 on the highest risk imports of animals, animal products, plants and plant products will continue to apply alongside the customs controls which have already been introduced.

Minister for Brexit Opportunities, Jacob Rees-Mogg said:


  Today’s decision will allow British businesses to focus on their recovery from the pandemic, navigate global supply chain issues and ensure that new costs are not passed on to consumers.

  It’s vital that we have the right import controls regime in place, so we’ll now be working with industry to review these remaining controls so that they best suit the UK’s own interests.

  We want the process for importing goods from the EU to be safe, secure and efficient and we want to harness innovative new technologies to streamline processes and reduce frictions. It’s precisely because of Brexit that we’re able to build this UK-focussed system

  The UK Government is committed to ensuring the process for importing goods remains safe, secure and efficient and will harness innovative new technologies to streamline future processes and reduce frictions.

  Our engagement with industry will be guided by these objectives, and will build on existing work already taking place, including on the UK Single Trade Window – a new digital gateway that will help traders to more easily move goods globally.


John Keefe, Director of Public Affairs. Eurotunnel said:


  Eurotunnel supports this decision which will keep goods flowing seamlessly into the UK. It is good for traders as it reduces import declaration paperwork on food and perishables.

  It is good for transporters as it increases fluidity at the border and it is good for consumers as it keeps the cost of living down.


Michael Schymik, International Director of SEF Langdon’s said:


  The current paper-based SPS processes and procedures are unsuitable in a 21st century digital world.

  This change in policy towards a smarter digital border by the UK Government will allow the free flow of safe food products into Great Britain.

  The decision may lead to a return of more EU companies exporting to the GB market, increasing competition and ultimately lowering prices for the consumer.


Notes to editors:


    Controls no longer being introduced for EU goods July 2022 are:

    
        A requirement for Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks currently at destination to be moved to a Border Control Post (BCP)
      
      
        A requirement for safety and security declarations on EU imports
      
      
        A requirement for health certification for further SPS imports

30/09/2021,Vulnerable households across the country will be able to access a new £500m support fund to help them with essentials over the coming months as the country continues its recovery from the pandemic.,"
    
          £500m support available to help those most in need as we enter the final stages of recovery
  Money available to councils in October 2021
  Bolsters support already in place to help vulnerable households and individuals
Vulnerable households across the country will be able to access a new £500m support fund to help them with essentials over the coming months as the country continues its recovery from the pandemic.

The new Household Support Fund will support millions of households in England and will be distributed by councils in England, who know their local areas best and can directly help those who need it most, including for example, through small grants to meet daily needs such as food, clothing, and utilities. Cash will be made available to Local Authorities in October 2021.

The Barnett formula will apply in the usual way to additional funding in England. The devolved administrations will therefore receive up to £79m of the £500m.

With more people in work and the economy bouncing back, the Government is focused on investing in jobs and skills – increasing prospects and wages across the country – whilst ensuring those in greatest need can access vital support to help cover every day costs. Alongside this, the government’s Plan for Jobs is helping people move back into employment so they can earn a regular wage, progress and increase their financial resilience.

Families will also continue to benefit from the energy price cap, recent rise in Local Housing Allowance and increases in the National Living Wage.

Thérèse Coffey, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said:


  Over the last year, we have helped millions of people provide for their families. Many are now back on their feet but we know that some may still need further support. Our targeted Household Support Fund is here to help those vulnerable households with essential costs as we push through the last stages of our recovery from the pandemic.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said:


  Everyone should be able to afford the essentials, and we are committed to ensuring that is the case.

  Our new Household Support Fund will provide a lifeline for those at risk of struggling to keep up with their bills over the winter, adding to the support the government is already providing to help people with the cost of living.


The UK Government has kept its Covid-related economic support in place until September, helping people through the toughest stages of the pandemic and well beyond the end of the roadmap, with more generous timelines than other countries in Europe.

This new fund will run over winter and those in need of support should contact their local council who will help them access the fund.

This fund bolsters support from the Warm Home Discount which provides a £140 rebate on energy bills each winter to over 2.2 million low-income households and the Cold Weather Payment which provides £25 extra a week for poorer households when the temperature is consistently below zero.

Earlier this year the government expanded the £220 million Holiday Activities and Food programme, which has offered nutritious meals and enriching activities to disadvantaged children across the Easter and Summer holidays, and will do so again this Christmas.

And to further support families with children, the Government has doubled free childcare for eligible working parents, worth up to £5,000 per child every year and increased the value of Healthy Start vouchers in April by over a third, helping disadvantaged women who are pregnant or have children under four to purchase fresh fruit and vegetables, boosting the long-term health of their children.

As the Barnett formula will apply in the usual way to additional funding in England, the devolved administrations will receive up to £79m of the £500m (£41m for the Scottish Government, £25m for the Welsh Government and £14m for the NI Executive). It will be for the devolved administrations to decide how to allocate this additional funding.

28/11/2022,Thousands more people will get access to early legal help over the next 2 years after the government announced £12 million of new grant funding today. (28 November 2022).,"
    
          

£12 million to help vulnerable people struggling with legal problems
  focus on early intervention to resolve issues before going to court
  33,000 supported since October 2020


The funding will be awarded to charities and organisations providing support for people facing disputes – helping them to better understand their issues and avoid costly court proceedings.

More than 33,000 people have been supported by organisations receiving similar government grants since October 2020 and nearly two-thirds of cases were resolved before reaching court.

Justice Minister Lord Bellamy said:


  Those who most need support should be able to access it quickly and easily, which is why we’re increasing funding for organisations providing this vital service.

  Early intervention helps prevent people from undergoing lengthy court proceedings - saving time, money and unnecessary stress.


It adds to more than £5 million of investment this year, including a £1 million cost-of-living grant, to help organisations respond to increasing demand for free legal advice. Specialist guidance is offered in person, by telephone or online, to help deal with problems before they escalate or to support those who need to appear in court.

The grant will replace the current Help Accessing Legal Support grant worth £3.2 million which is due to end in June 2023.

The funding benefits people in difficult situations including Helen (not her real name), who was supported by an organisation funded by the grant after leaving an abusive relationship. She continued to suffer harassment from her ex-partner and contacted her local free advice charity who provided guidance on navigating family court proceedings. Helen was able to secure protective court orders aimed at restricting her ex-partner’s access to the family home and preventing violent behaviour against her and her daughter.

Helen said:


  [The advisor] gave me sound legal advice to help me make choices to keep me safe and get my house back.

  If I had not had access to the [advice] it is quite likely that I may have not had the courage or the understanding to go to court to seek these orders, or even worse, that I would have returned to an abusive and volatile relationship as I would not have had any other option.


This legal support is provided by organisations across the country, using the funding where it is needed.

Cara Walker, Mobile Legal Adviser at Norfolk Community Law Service, said:


  Providing outreach legal help to people is vital in a large rural county like Norfolk. The Ministry of Justice funding enables me to work with clients on a long term basis in community settings, who have a range of complex legal problems-including welfare benefits, domestic abuse and immigration.


Cathy Ashley, Chief Executive of Family Rights Group, said:


  Our Advice and Advocacy Service provides social care and legal expertise to families, including parents whose children are in need or subject to child protection enquiries and relatives raising children who cannot live at home.

  The Help Accessing Legal Support Grant is funding our new webchat service for families and is enabling us to provide more intensive support to callers to our advice line, allowing more children to live safely and thrive within their families and safely averting them entering a care system already in crisis.

09/11/2022,"More than 1,000 customers will receive payments after the CMA found Barclays failed to send PPI information","
    
          The CMA has written publicly to Barclays after the bank failed to send a reminder to customers of payment protection insurance (PPI) policies.

Under the Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) PPI order, PPI providers must send annual reminders to customers that set out clearly the cost of their policy, the type of cover they have and remind them of their right to cancel. Barclays breached the order by failing to send reminders to up to 1,306 of its former Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance policy holders between 2014 and 2017.

These customers, who held both a mortgage and an associated PPI policy with Barclays, had moved house and notified Barclays of their new address. Barclays failed to act properly on this information, with affected customers not receiving reminders.

Barclays only discovered this breach in late 2021. Failure to provide these reminders meant that customers may have kept their policies for longer than they needed or stopped checking for cheaper or better alternatives, and this may have cost them money.

The payout, of up to £1m is made up of refunds and goodwill payments, and comes after Barclays reported the breach to the CMA in October 2021, which it is required to do under the PPI order.

Adam Land, Senior Director of Remedies, Business and Financial Analysis at the CMA, said:


  Barclays will pay customers up to £1 million after breaching the CMA’s PPI Order. That’s an average payment of around £750 per customer, which is particularly important as the cost-of-living crisis bites. We will now work with Barclays to ensure these payments are made to customers.

  It’s important that all PPI providers take notice – we won’t hesitate to take action, as we have done here, if customers have lost out.


The CMA cannot currently impose financial penalties on businesses for breaches of this kind but has called for the power to do so.

Imposing fines would allow the CMA to take quicker and stronger action against companies that break the law. It would also allow the CMA to increase the deterrent effect of its enforcement and help ensure businesses take the obligations which the CMA imposes on them seriously for the benefit of UK consumers.

Notes to Editors


    This is not the first time Barclays has breached the order. Find out more about previous breaches and the CMA’s enforcement here
  
  
    We refer to ‘up to’ 1,306 customers because Barclays is still investigating the breach and may find that a small number of these 1,306 customers have in fact received the information they should have done.
  
  
    The CMA does not currently have the power to impose financial penalties for breaches of this kind. The CMA has called for such powers in order to increase incentives for businesses to comply with market and merger remedies. The Government is set to consult on whether the CMA will be given such powers.
  
  
    The CMA’s public letter to Barclays ensures that the bank will contact all customers with a PPI policy, who were affected by the most recent breach, and make payouts to compensate for the missing reminders
  
  
    These breaches will also be logged on the CMA’s register of breaches, which records all breaches of market and merger remedies and is updated quarterly with the next update being January.

14/12/2021,The next review of State Pension age has been launched by the government today.,"
    
          The review will consider whether the rules around pensionable age are appropriate, based on the latest life expectancy data and other evidence.

The Pensions Act 2014 requires government to regularly review State Pension age, and in accordance with law, this latest Review must be published by 7 May 2023.

State Pension age is currently 66 and two further increases are currently set out in legislation: a gradual rise to 67 for those born on or after April 1960; and a gradual rise to 68 between 2044 and 2046 for those born on or after April 1977. The first Review of State Pension age was undertaken in 2017 and concluded that the next Review should consider whether the increase to age 68 should be brought forward to 2037-39 before tabling any changes to legislation.

As the number of people over State Pension age increases, due to a growing population and people on average living longer, the government needs to make sure that decisions on how to manage its costs are, robust, fair and transparent for taxpayers now and in the future. It must also ensure that as the population becomes older, the State Pension continues to provide the foundation for retirement planning and financial security.

Therefore, this review will consider a wide range of evidence, for example, it will:

examine the implications of the latest life expectancy data
  provide a balanced assessment of the costs of an ageing population and future State Pension expenditure
  consider labour market changes and people’s ability and opportunities to work over State Pension age
  and develop options for setting the legislative timetable for State Pension age that are transparent and fair"
13/07/2022,"Claims for Pension Credit more than doubled during the Department for Work and Pension’s recent Pension Credit Day of Action, new figures have revealed.","
    
          Over 10,000 Pension Credit claims were made during the week of 13 June – an increase of 275% compared to that same week in 2021.

The two-step in the right direction was helped by Strictly Come Dancing’s Len Goodman, who teamed up with Minister for Pensions Guy Opperman to help spread the message. The pair’s social media video encouraging Pension Credit claims has now been viewed over 1.3 million times.

The boost means even more pensioners could be in line to receive extra financial support worth an average of over £3,300 a year.

Minister for Pensions Guy Opperman said:


  We recognise the challenges some pensioners will be facing with the cost of living which is why promoting Pension Credit is a priority.

  The success of our Day of Action means more pensioners can get the support they’re entitled to, but we’re not stopping there. We’re continuing to get the word out about Pension Credit, calling on everyone with retired family, friends and loved ones to check in with them and see if they can get this extra financial support, which can make a huge difference to people’s lives.


The Day of Action also saw charities, stakeholders, broadcasters and a whole range of partners getting involved to encourage people to claim.

Pension Credit is designed to help with daily living costs for people over State Pension age and on a low income, though you do not need to be in receipt of State Pension to receive it.

It tops up a person’s income to a minimum of £182.60 per week for single pensioners and to £278.70 for couples.

Currently, over 1.4 million pensioners in Britain receive Pension Credit. However, many are still not claiming this extra financial help.

Rich Mackenzie, DWP Visiting Officer, said:


  Many people who could claim Pension Credit aren’t.

  I would appeal to anyone who comes into contact with pensioners to ask how much they know about Pension Credit. It could be something that helps, and in the current financial climate, there’s no doubt that more people will experience hardship.

  Pension Credit won’t solve every problem, but it will go a long way to alleviating difficulties. It should be a collective endeavour for us all.


Even a small Pension Credit award can provide access to a wide range of other benefits – such as help with housing costs, council tax or heating bills. For those over 75, this includes continued entitlement to a free TV licence.

Pension Credit can be claimed by phone and online, ensuring that older people can apply safely and easily, wherever they are. The online Pension Credit calculator is also on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

14/03/2022,Children of separated parents are set to benefit from changes to the Child Maintenance Service announced today (14 March 2022) as new powers are revealed.,"
    
          The new powers being introduced will expand the list of companies and organisations required to provide information to the Child Maintenance Service (CMS) which will help the service trace the paying parent, calculate maintenance and enforce arrears more effectively.

To make it easier for companies to respond quickly and securely, the process is now being simplified so information can be passed on by secure digital means instead of compulsory in-person visits from CMS inspectors.

The government is also bringing forward proposals to allow all communications to be digital, which will speed up the service and make sure information is passed on to parents quickly.

Following responses from children’s charities, parents and interested organisations, the government has published the details of the new powers in its response to the consultation on the Child Maintenance Service.

DWP Lords Minister Baroness Stedman-Scott said:


  At the heart of these changes is our commitment to making sure children get the financial support they need to have the best start in life.



  We’re bringing the service into the modern age, removing barriers that can slow down cases and prevent money reaching children.



  The Child Maintenance Service collected or arranged £1 billion for children over the last 12 months, improving the lives of hundreds of thousands of children across the UK.


The CMS is set up for parents who have not been able to make a private arrangement about how their child’s living costs will be paid. Child maintenance payments help lift around 120,000 children across the UK out of poverty each year.

Plans for future changes when the legislation timetable allows will:

include unearned income in child maintenance calculations
  extinguish small volumes of very low value debt (£6.99 and under) where the maintenance calculation has ended but there remains an outstanding debt, and the value of the debt is substantially less than the cost of collecting it
  extinguish arrears where child maintenance has been deducted from a parent’s earnings and their employer has gone into administration, and the outstanding arrears can no longer be recovered."
27/04/2022,The CMA’s Annual Concurrency Report shows how competition authorities have helped deliver benefits to households in 2021 to 2022 in the regulated sectors.,"
    
          Competition law in the UK is enforced by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the nation’s primary competition authority, and, in certain sectors, by the relevant regulators.

In order for the regime to work effectively, there are rules on how the CMA and the sector regulators work together, which are known as the ‘concurrency’ arrangements.

Sectors covered by these arrangements account for approximately 25% of UK GDP and include services that most people use every day, such as communications, energy and water. This year’s report is issued against the background of increasing concerns about the cost of living, following the economic shocks caused by the global Covid-19 pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine.

The report outlines how the CMA and other regulators have been working to promote competition and improve their collective ability to enforce the law. It also considers new challenges, like shortages and shipping bottlenecks, which have emerged over the past year as the global economy recovered from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Highlights of the 2021 to 2022 report include:

5 cases were brought to a close, including the PSR’s first infringement decision which led to fines totalling more than £33 million
  3 investigations – led by the CMA, Ofgem and Ofwat – resulted in firms signing formal commitments to improve their practices
  4 new investigations were launched –in the digital advertising, electric vehicle charging and financial services sectors
The report also shows how the concurrency arrangements allow the regulators to help each other on a range of matters, including technical advice on specific markets and procedural guidance in competition investigations.

Andrea Coscelli, CMA Chief Executive, said:


  This year, as we began to recover from the impacts of Covid-19, we also faced new challenges. The energy crisis and the invasion of Ukraine shook the world and have contributed to a sharp rise in the cost of living.

  During difficult times, effective cooperation between authorities is especially important to help ensure that essential services are working well for the millions of people who depend on them.

  By promoting healthy and competitive markets, we can help make sure households benefit from fair prices, good choice and quality services.

  I’m pleased with the positive outcomes our joined-up approach has brought this year – and I’m confident that the UK’s competition authorities will continue to help people get a fair deal.

24/03/2022,"A new poll of 2,000 UK adults has revealed that over half (54%) of late-night online shoppers said they had done so while drinking alcohol and more than 8 in 10 (86%) shopped while distracted watching TV, leaving them vulnerable to misleading sales tactics.","
    
          1 in 2 shopping online at night drink and click
  CMA warns about sneaky sales tactics as cost of living rises
  Digitally native Gen Z first to admit they’re susceptible to online rip-offs
As the cost of living continues to increase, and with almost one-third of all retail purchases now taking place online, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has become increasingly concerned about the impact of “sneaky” sales practices on consumers.

The survey comes as part of the CMA’s new campaign The Online Rip-Off Tip-Off to help shoppers spot and avoid misleading online tactics, which could result in them being ripped off.

This latest phase of the campaign warns shoppers that such sales ploys can be even more effective at manipulating them if they shop at certain times of the day, or when they are in certain states of mind. And it advises all shoppers to be careful before they drink and click.

Initial research highlighted that misleading tactics are designed to play on behavioural biases, often without people realising that they are being manipulated. This means they can be even more effective when shoppers are distracted, hungry, or tired for example.

With 8 in 10 people who shop online late at night saying they do so, or have done so, while watching TV, and around three quarters  saying the same about listening to the radio/music (69%) or scrolling on social media (70%), this latest poll highlights how easy it is to be unwittingly misled.

The CMA also warns that no one is immune. Its survey revealed that more than a third of Gen Z, dubbed the ‘digitally native’ generation, admit to being susceptible to online rip-offs. And they are the biggest night-time online shopping spenders, splurging £290 on average last month.

George Lusty, Senior Director for Consumer Protection, explained:


  As the cost of living continues to rise, every penny we spend must count.

  We’re increasingly concerned about online businesses using sales tactics to push people into parting with their cash.

  And the time of day or mindset you’re in when shopping can make you more vulnerable to being unwittingly misled.

  Check out the CMA’s Online Rip-Off Tip-Off, which has been launched to help shoppers spot and avoid potential online rip-offs.


4 common misleading online tactics are:

Subscription traps - misleading a customer into signing up to, and paying for, an unwanted subscription that can be difficult to cancel
  Hidden charges – unexpected compulsory fees, charges or taxes being added when someone tries to make an online purchase
  Pressure selling – a tactic used to give a false impression of availability or popularity of a product or service
  Fake reviews – reviews that do not reflect an actual customer’s genuine opinion or experience of a product or service
Fronted by TV presenter and consumer champion Angellica Bell, the Online Rip-off Tip-Off campaign launched with a film depicting misleading online tactics in a real-life market, with the key message “you wouldn’t put up with it offline, so don’t do so online”. The aim of the campaign is to make consumers aware of misleading online practices, understand the negative impact they can have and provide tips on how to avoid them.

22/07/2022,New prison wings designed to get offenders clean will receive funding thanks to the government’s 10-year strategy to tackle drug-fuelled crime.,"
    
          

£120 million to crack down on addiction and tackle drug-fuelled crime
  abstinence-led drug wings to be rolled out in prisons
  community drug testing boosted and extra support for prison leavers to prevent relapse


A £120 million drive, announced today (22 July 2022), will see the rollout of specialised wings across England and Wales which will treat drug addiction, including through abstinence, and then keep prisoners substance-free.

This tough approach will follow them through the prison gate, with offenders kept under closer control in the community with more drug testing, treatment and extra support to kick their addictions and keep our streets safer.

Ground-breaking new ‘problem-solving courts’ will also direct drug and alcohol abusers to tackle their addiction head-on or face tough consequences – including time in jail where necessary.

Illegal drug use costs the taxpayer nearly £22 billion each year, including NHS, prison and police costs.

Around half of all prisoners have a drug problem but those who get treatment are 19 percentage points less likely to reoffend.

Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Dominic Raab said:


  Drugs trap criminals in a destructive cycle of offending and prevents them from getting their lives back on track.

  Our plan will get offenders into rehab earlier, get them off all drugs permanently and support prisoners once they’re released into the community. That will drive down reoffending, and make our streets safer.


As a result of the funding announced today, up to 18 abstinence-led ‘drug recovery wings’ and 100 ‘incentivised substance-free living units’ (ISFL units) will be rolled out in prisons by 2025.

Currently, addicted prisoners willing to turn their lives around are supported to get off illicit drugs at one of 25 ISFL units, where they receive regular drug testing, peer support, and incentives such as extra gym time for good progress.

The new system will see heroin addicts and other opiate abusers then move to the new drug recovery wings for six months of further intensive treatment, if needed. Here addicts will be supported to get clean from all drugs, including substitutes like methadone, through abstinence – overseen by up to 50 new specialists who will work with prisons.

These abstinent prisoners will then transition back through the incentivised units and into the general prison population, with continued support to stay drug-free.

The £120 million funding will also improve the support offenders have access to once they leave prison, to give them the best chance of staying on the straight and narrow. This includes:

50 ‘health and justice partnership co-ordinators’, who will work between prisons, probation and treatment providers, to ensure offenders’ treatment plans transfer smoothly from prison to the community.
  Up to 50 more probation staff will oversee drug testing for criminals serving a community sentence to keep them clean.
  The launch of two problem-solving court pilots in Teesside and Liverpool to combat drug- and alcohol-fuelled crime by giving offenders in the community a choice to either address their issues and engage with the help offered or face swift reprisals.
  Birmingham Magistrates’ Court will also pilot a problem-solving court for female offenders with complex needs, including substance misuse.
Sean Oliver, HMP Oakwood’s Director, said:


  Abstinence can be key to get offenders off drugs and the start of turning their lives around.

  The dedicated drug recovery support in our prison is already helping us provide prisoners with the wraparound support to ensure they’re drug free when released.


Noreen Oliver, founder and managing director of Burton Addiction Centre, said:


  Drugs can have a devastating impact on families and communities. From the heartbroken parents asking a child to leave the family home, to the loved ones who sit and wait in fear for a knock on their door from police officers.

  We have to be more ambitious in helping those caught in the revolving door of drugs and crime, by recognising that a significant number of prisoners were not criminals before they became addicts.

  Making abstinence an integral part of the treatment system will give prisoners the chance and choice to live drug-free and crime-free lives and make our communities safer.


The funding is part of the government’s wider 10-year drugs plan which aims to tackle drugs and prevent crime, backed by nearly £900 million. This takes the government’s total investment on combating drugs over the next three years to £3 billion.

Notes to editors

Initiatives funded by the £120 million include:
    Rolling out up to 18 new drug recovery wings and boosting the number of incentivised substance-free living units from 25 to 100
      Piloting substance misuse problem-solving courts in the community to combat drug and alcohol-fuelled crime
      A new drug-testing contract in prisons and the community, meaning a larger number of tests can be undertaken.
      Up to 50 drug strategy leads in all male category C and women’s prisons. They will drive the development and delivery of drug recovery wings and ISFLs locally.

10/02/2021,Housing Secretary unveils a 5-point  plan which will provide reassurance to homeowners and confidence to the housing market.,"
    
          

Housing Secretary announces the government will pay for the removal of unsafe cladding for all leaseholders in high-rise buildings, providing reassurance and protecting them from costs
  New levy and tax on developers to ensure industry contributes
  Measures will boost the housing market and free up homeowners to once again buy and sell their properties


Hundreds of thousands of leaseholders will be protected from the cost of replacing unsafe cladding on their homes, as Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick unveiled a five-point plan which will provide reassurance to homeowners and bring confidence to the housing market.

With an unprecedented £5 billion investment in building safety, including £3.5 billion announced today (10 February 2021), the Housing Secretary confirmed to the House of Commons that the government will fully fund the cost of replacing unsafe cladding for all leaseholders in residential buildings 18 metres (6 storeys) and over in England.

This will ensure funding is targeted at the highest risk buildings in line with longstanding independent expert advice and evidence, with Home Office analysis of fire and rescue service statistics showing buildings between 18 and 30 metres are four times as likely to suffer a fire with fatalities or serious casualties than apartment buildings in general.

Lower-rise buildings, with a lower risk to safety, will gain new protection from the costs of cladding removal with a generous new scheme offered to buildings between 11 and 18 metres. This will pay for cladding removal – where it is needed – through a long-term, low interest, government-backed financing arrangement.

Under the scheme, no leaseholder will ever pay more than £50 a month towards the removal of unsafe cladding. This will provide reassurance and security to leaseholders, and mortgage providers can be confident that where cladding removal is needed, properties will be worth lending against.

The government is working with industry to reduce the need for EWS1 forms, preventing leaseholders from facing delays and allowing hundreds of thousands of homes to be sold, bought, or re-mortgaged once again.

The Housing Secretary today announced plans to introduce a, ‘Gateway 2’ developer levy. The proposed levy will be targeted and apply when developers seek permission to develop certain high-rise buildings in England.

In addition, a new tax will be introduced for the UK residential property development sector. This will raise at least £2 billion over a decade to help pay for cladding remediation costs. The tax will ensure that the largest property developers make a fair contribution to the remediation programme, reflecting the benefit they will derive from restoring confidence to the UK housing market. The government will consult on the policy design in due course.

The government will protect future generations from similar mistakes by bringing forward legislation this year to tighten the regulation of building safety and to review the construction products regime to prevent malpractice arising again.

Today’s measures will mean people living in homes which they have been prevented from selling, or re-mortgaging, through no fault of their own, will now be able to move on with their lives.

Housing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  This is a comprehensive plan to remove unsafe cladding, support leaseholders, restore confidence to this part of the housing market and ensure this situation never arises again.

  Our unprecedented intervention means the hundreds of thousands of leaseholders who live in higher-rise buildings will now pay nothing towards the cost of removing unsafe cladding.

  Remedying the failures of building safety cannot just be a responsibility for taxpayers. That is why we will also be introducing a levy and tax on developers to contribute to righting the wrongs of the past.

  These measures will provide certainty to residents and lenders, boosting the housing market, reinstating the value of properties and getting buying and selling homes back on track. We are working with lenders and surveyors to make this happen.

  Our landmark intervention will make homes safer and free those who did the right thing – saving for years to get on the property ladder – to enjoy the homes in which they have invested so much.


Barclays:


  Barclays welcomes this announcement as a positive step forward. These changes will bring greater certainty and clarity for homeowners, prospective buyers and surveyors.

  We expect that will make it far easier for buyers, sellers and lenders to value properties, aiding this part of the housing market to start moving again.

  Barclays remains open to support our customers and prospective buyers with any of their home ownership needs, including in this part of the market.


Joe Garner – CEO Nationwide Building Society said:


  Nationwide welcomes the £3.5 billion grant funding the government has announced to ensure the cladding on peoples’ home is safe and to protect the people who live in them. This is a decisive step forward which we hope brings some relief to people worried about the safety of their homes.

  Supporting people who find themselves living in this difficult position could not be more important. We look forward to working with government, lenders and other interested parties to understand the details and implement the initiative quickly.


The government is aware that securing appropriate professional indemnity insurance to cover the completion of EWS1 forms is a major barrier to qualified professionals undertaking EWS1 forms. The government is therefore committing today to work towards a targeted, state-backed indemnity scheme for qualified professionals unable to obtain professional indemnity insurance for the completion of EWS1 forms.

The government will work closely with industry to design an appropriate scheme. Further details on the scheme, including eligibility and the claims process, will be provided in the coming weeks.

The Grenfell tragedy laid bare failings in the building industry dating back 30 years. Today’s announcement is a further step by the government to bring about the biggest changes to building safety in a generation, ensuring people are safe and feel safe in their own homes.

The measures build on steps already taken to support leaseholders, including £1.6 billion of funding to remediate unsafe cladding, the £30 million Waking Watch fund to help end unfair and excessive costs and new legislation in the Building Safety Bill which will ensure homes are made and kept safer in future.
"
18/07/2020,"The government is bringing forward changes that will improve building and fire safety, so that people will be, and will feel, safer in their homes.","
    
          Background

The government is bringing forward fundamental changes in the draft Building Safety Bill that will improve building and fire safety, so that people will be, and will feel, safer in their homes.

The Grenfell Tower fire in West London on 14 June 2017 claimed 72 lives. The tragedy exposed serious failings across the whole system of building and managing high-rise homes.

We took immediate steps to make residents safer, and asked Dame Judith Hackitt to carry out an independent review of building regulations and fire safety to understand the causes of the fire.

The review concluded that the whole system needed major reform and that residents’ safety needed to be a greater priority through the entire life cycle of a building – from design and construction, through to when people are living in their homes.

The government accepted the review’s recommendations and this draft Bill, which, alongside the existing Fire Safety Bill and fire safety consultation will set out how we are bringing forward those proposals to provide the biggest improvements to building safety in nearly 40 years.


Read the draft Building Safety Bill


What is a draft Bill?

A draft Bill is published to enable consultation and scrutiny before the Bill is introduced to Parliament.

The draft Building Safety Bill will be examined by a Parliamentary committee who will report with feedback and recommendations before the Bill is finalised. We will also work with stakeholders on areas that need refinement or further consultation to finalise measures.

The Bill will then be introduced formally in the House of Commons or the House of Lords. If it progresses through all stages in Parliament, the Bill will then be presented to the Queen for her formal agreement where it then becomes an Act and the powers come into force.

What does it mean for residents?

We are putting measures in place to make people safer in their homes. The draft Bill will ensure that there will always be someone responsible for keeping residents safe in high rise buildings – those 18 metres and above. They will also have to listen and respond to residents’ concerns and ensure their voices are heard – they will be called the ‘Accountable Person’.

Residents and leaseholders will have access to vital safety information about their building and new complaints handling requirements will be introduced to make sure effective action is taken where concerns are raised.

To oversee all this and make sure that Accountable Persons are carrying out their duties properly, there will also be a new national regulator for building safety, within the Health and Safety Executive.

It will ensure that high rise buildings and the people who live in them are being kept safe and will have new powers to raise and enforce higher standards of safety and performance across all buildings. The regulator will appoint a panel of residents who will have a voice in the development of its work.

We are committed to making sure that leaseholders won’t pay unaffordable costs for historic repairs to their buildings. We will continue to engage with stakeholders, including leaseholders, on this issue while the draft Bill is being scrutinised.

We will be speeding up work with the finance and insurance industries, to protect leaseholders from unaffordable costs of fixing historic defects, but without relying on taxpayers’ money.

We will also address insurance issues around building safety. A new ‘building safety charge’ will make it easy for leaseholders to see and know what they are being charged for when it comes to keeping their building safe. But, to make sure that these costs are affordable, we have deliberately included powers to limit the costs that can be re-charged to leaseholders.

For the first time, new build homebuyers will have their right to complain to a New Homes Ombudsman, protected in legislation, and developers will be required to be a member of the scheme. The New Homes Ombudsman will hold developers to account, including the ability to require developers to pay compensation.

Together, measures in the draft Building Safety Bill, Fire Safety Bill, and Fire Safety Order consultation will improve safety standards for residents of all blocks of flats of all heights, with even more stringent approaches and oversight for buildings in scope.  

What does it mean for the industry?

The draft Bill will make sure that those responsible for the safety of residents are accountable for any mistakes and must put them right. It will fully establish the regulator that will enforce new rules and take strong actions against those who break them.

The regulator will have 3 main functions: to oversee the safety and standard of all buildings, directly assure the safety of higher-risk buildings; and improve the competence of people responsible for managing and overseeing building work. 

It will operate a new, more stringent set of rules for high-rise residential buildings. The new set of rules, contained in the draft Bill, will apply when buildings are designed, constructed and then later occupied.

At each of these 3 stages, it will be clear who is responsible for managing the potential risks and what is required to move to the next stage enabling a ‘golden thread’ of vital information about the building to be gathered over its lifetime.

When residents move into a building that falls under the new set of rules, it will need to be registered with the Building Safety Regulator and apply for a Building Assurance Certificate. The Accountable Person will need to conduct and maintain a safety case risk assessment for the building and appoint a Building Safety Manager to oversee it day to day. 

Building inspectors who are responsible for signing buildings off as safe for people to live in will also have to follow the new rules and must register with the regulator.

The draft Bill will also give the government new powers to better regulate construction materials and products and ensure they are safe to use.

What else has the government done?

The government is doing its part in bringing forward the legislation but the industry, which has fed into these reforms from the start, must now lead the way.

However, we have not stood still and the work we are doing so far is already improving the safety of buildings so people are safer in their homes.

We have banned the use of combustible materials on the external walls of high-rise buildings, published clearer guidance on existing regulations that buildings owners must follow, and we are making it mandatory for sprinklers to be fitted in all new blocks of flats over 11 metres high.

We identified buildings with unsafe Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) cladding and are providing £600 million to remove and replace it in both private and social-sector homes over 18 metres high. We are also providing £1 billion to remove and replace non-ACM cladding materials from high-rise residential blocks.

As part of our response to the report from Phase 1 of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, we have introduced the Fire Safety Bill to Parliament. This gives local fire and rescue services the power to make sure building owners deal with potential fire risks in their building.

Next steps

The draft Bill will be published on Monday 20 July as the government is keen for it to receive further views from parliamentarians, residents and industry via the Parliamentary process of pre-legislative scrutiny, before the Bill is then introduced to Parliament.

26/03/2021,The newly named Supporting Families programme to support some of the most vulnerable families in society.,"
    
          

Successful programme to support vulnerable families launches its next phase, backed by £165 million in funding for 2021 to 2022.
  Over 400,000 vulnerable families supported to build brighter futures since 2015.
  Number of children going into care reduced through the programme, and the number of adults going to prison.
  New additional £7.9 million fund launched to improve how councils use data to support families, including by providing key workers with the information that they need.


The next phase of the government’s flagship programme to support some of the most vulnerable families in society has been launched by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick today (26 March 2021), backed by £165 million funding.

The newly named ‘Supporting Families’ programme, previously known as the ‘Troubled Families’ programme, includes work to support people to leave abusive relationships, get the right joined-up support for those with mental health issues and help people to find work – all part of the government’s comprehensive programme of work to support and unite communities.

Through the programme, which began in 2012 – families are assigned a dedicated keyworker, who works with every member of the family and brings local services together to resolve issues at an early stage, before they develop into more significant problems.

Since 2015, over 400,000 vulnerable families have received support to help them turn their lives around and build brighter futures, and over 870,000 families have benefited from the programme’s ‘whole family’ approach to tackling problems.

The programme has delivered significant results while reducing costs of services for the taxpayer – with the proportion of children supported by the programme going into care reduced by a third and the proportion of adults going to prison reduced by a quarter.

Housing Secretary, Rt Hon. Robert Jenrick MP said:


  Working hand in hand with local councils and other partners we have helped over 400,000 vulnerable families.

  For the next phase, Supporting Families will continue this important work backed by £165 million funding to help families with multiple complex problems to overcome difficulties as early as possible. It is a critical part of our moral mission to tackle intergenerational unemployment, crime, domestic abuse and family breakdown.

  As we come out of the COVID-19 pandemic it is more important than ever we support families. The last year has shown what can be achieved if different agencies act as one and wrap their arms around the most vulnerable. That is the objective of Supporting Families, the renewed programme to turn around lives and help families to achieve their potential.


Eddie Hughes MP, Minister for Housing and Rough Sleeping said:


  The government is supporting the most vulnerable in our communities and the Supporting Families programme will help us to make lasting change to many more lives”.

  By working with every member of a family and bringing local services together, Supporting Families keyworkers get to the heart of the multiple and connected difficulties many families face and tackle them early – overcoming obstacles before they develop into something more serious and reducing the cost of services to the taxpayer.


During the pandemic, services funded by the programme played a vital role in helping families, providing access to food and equipment for children home learning. To continue to build relationships and ensure families were supported during lockdown, local areas introduced virtual meetups and garden or doorstep visits, within the social distancing guidelines and restrictions.

Building stronger data is key focus of the next phase of the programme, and the government today announced the launch of a new Data Accelerator Fund, backed by £7.9 million in additional funding, to improve how councils use data to support vulnerable families.

This includes identifying families that need support and helping frontline workers get the information they need. Councils will be able to bid for this funding, split over two years, to set up new data projects.

The government has today also published research on a £9.5 million Supporting Families Against Youth Violence fund, which supported 21 areas to run projects combatting knife crime between 2018 and 2020. The research showed that a whole family approaches were seen as effective in preventing youth crime.

The programme, previously named the ‘Troubled Families programme,’ will now be known as ‘Supporting Families’, to better reflect the role that keyworkers play.

06/03/2020,Bereaved parents spared children’s burial and cremation costs.,"
    
          

government fund saved over £500,000 for families
  work continues to increase awareness of the fund to help grieving parents


Parents grieving the tragic loss of a child have used a government fund to cover the costs of their burial or cremation more than 1,000 times since the scheme’s inception last July.

The Children’s Funeral Fund for England (CFF) provides bereaved parents with valuable practical support at a very difficult time. The scheme aims to reduce the financial burden for families by reimbursing burial and cremation authorities, and funeral directors directly.

Since it launched the fund has awarded over £500,000 to spare families footing the bill and is available regardless of the family’s income.

Justice Minister Alex Chalk said:


  The loss of a child is an unimaginable tragedy for any parent.

  While nothing can ever remove the pain that bereaved families experience, this government is determined to do everything in its power to support them.

  I am proud that the scheme has already helped so many, and we continue to increase awareness of the help available during such a distressing time.


Labour MP Carolyn Harris (Swansea East), who tragically lost her own 8-year old son, Martin, campaigned successfully for the introduction of the fund to help bereaved parents.

Ms Harris MP said:


  Sharing my family’s heartbreak and my son Martin’s memory was the one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, but I knew how desperately important a Children’s Funeral Fund would be to other bereaved parents.

  It saddens me that so many children have died since the fund was established and my heart breaks for all those families whose lives have been so devastatingly torn apart.  I only hope that by lifting the financial burden of funeral costs from parents, we have been able to offer a glimmer of light in what will be a very dark place.


Every year in England an estimated 3,800 children die under the age of 18, and there are a further 2,700 stillbirths. The Ministry of Justice wants to help as many people as possible who find themselves in such a devastating circumstance, and continues to improve awareness of the fund.  

Nikki Lancaster, who lost their 10 year old son Lennon in 2017, said:


  Both myself and my partner gave up work in order to provide round the clock medical care for our son Lennon. It was struggle financially but we made work. In 2017 Lennon sadly died aged 10. We had no savings and all of the benefits we were claiming stopped on the day he died. In the weeks and months after Lennon died we struggled to pay our bills and had to borrow money to pay for Lennon’s funeral. It put a huge strain on us during the worst time in our lives.

  As the parent of a bereaved child I know what a huge difference this fund will make to families like my own. It may not seem a lot, but it is one less thing to have to worry about during such a distressing time.


Andy Fletcher, Chief Executive of Together for Short Lives said:


  It is good news that so many bereaved parents facing the worst circumstances possible have benefited from this support. No family should have to worry about money when they are coming to terms with the death of a child. It is crucial that every family who is eligible for the Child Funeral Fund is given the opportunity to access it.


The only conditions for the scheme are that the child is under 18 at the time of death or is stillborn after the 24th week of pregnancy, that the burial or cremation takes place in England, and that the claim is submitted no later than 6 months after the funeral.

Notes to editors

The CFF came into force on 23 July 2019.
  Carolyn Harris MP (Swansea East, Labour) led a cross-party campaign for a fund to spare bereaved parents the additional distress of having to meet the cost of their child’s funeral at an extremely difficult time. In leading this campaign, she drew on her own personal experience of having to meet the funeral costs of her 8-year old son, Martin, who was killed in 1989.
  Under the fund arrangements, no bereaved family will have to pay the fees charged for a child’s cremation or burial or for a number of prescribed associated expenses.
  The fund provides for burial authorities and cremation authorities to apply to Government for the reimbursement of the fees which would otherwise be charged for the provision of the burial or cremation of an eligible child.
  It also provides for funeral directors to apply for reimbursement of certain associated expenses, including a £300 contribution towards the price of a coffin.
  If the person responsible for organising the burial or cremation chooses not to use a funeral director but makes the funeral arrangements themselves, they will be able to claim directly for the eligible associated expenses (with the burial or cremation fees being reimbursed directly to the provider).
  The only conditions for the scheme are that the child is under 18 at the time of death or is stillborn after the 24th week of pregnancy, that the burial or cremation takes place in England, and the claim is submitted no later than 6 months after the funeral.
  The scheme is not means-tested, and the residency or nationality of the deceased child, or of the person organising the burial or cremation, is not relevant in determining eligibility.
  Both the Welsh Government and the Scottish Government have established schemes, under devolved powers, to make financial support available to providers of burial and cremation for children.

15/06/2021,The Lord Chancellor shares his views on how tailored prisoner education can help us to build back a better and safer country for all.,"
    
          As Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, I spend every day immersed in the inner workings of the criminal justice system. After almost 2 years in the job, there is one statistic that continues to spur me on to do better.

Every year repeat offending costs society about £18 billion. That is a staggering figure and one we should never be prepared to accept. As we begin to recover from a global pandemic, it is a price we can ill afford to pay.

While I’m proud of this government’s work to see offenders punished for their wrongdoing, I’m acutely aware that releasing prisoners without finding solutions to help ensure they turn their lives round will ultimately result in more crime, greater harm to victims and an increased economic cost to society.

We know that education can play a huge role in cutting crime. Figures published in 2017 showed prisoners who undertook study during their sentence were 9 per cent less likely to go on to commit further crimes compared to those who didn’t. When individuals are equipped with skills needed to find jobs and contribute to society, they are better placed to accomplish this once released.

I have seen for myself how education changes lives. As a barrister, part-time judge and now as Lord Chancellor, I have too often seen people with conditions such as autism and dyslexia struggle through the criminal justice system. I know from my own family experience how difficult it is to get a proper diagnosis of these conditions. As chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Autism when I was a backbencher, I campaigned hard for better awareness and provision.

The same can be said for victims with neurodivergent conditions who may also find the justice system daunting. The new Victims’ Code, which came into effect last month, outlines the minimum level of information and service victims can expect at every stage of the justice process. It also provides enhanced rights for those with impaired social functioning, including special measures to help them to give evidence in court.

I have also had the privilege to see how much those with neurodivergent conditions like these have to offer with the right help and support — which is why I’m determined to make huge strides towards improving the education on offer inside our prison system, so that it better supports those with diverse learning needs.

We need to ensure all prisoners, including those with life-long learning conditions, get the help they need to engage with their rehabilitation and reduce their chances of reoffending.

This makes even more sense when we consider the fact that at least a third of all offenders in England and Wales have a learning disability or challenge, compared with an estimated 2 per cent of the population.

Creating a system that allows every offender to get the help they need will not just make our country fairer, it will also ease the financial burden inflicted on the law-abiding majority of the public by a criminal minority.

Today (15 June 2021), I can announce plans for an overhaul of the education on offer for prisoners with learning needs, which will be led by a team of educational specialists with experience in supporting those with neurodivergent conditions.

Crucially the team will identify prisoners with learning needs such as autism and dyslexia far quicker, so that we will know where to target improved education and training, which will be delivered using new and innovative methods of teaching.

If we are serious about rehabilitating neurodivergent offenders, then it is vital that we do this, so that we can fully understand the support they may need to get their lives back on track. It will then be up to them to put in the work.

My own family experience has taught me a huge amount about what it can be like for people with neurodivergent conditions to navigate a world that too often fails to understand their needs.

We can make a huge difference by setting those with similar conditions in the criminal justice system on the right path to better lives. In the long run I believe it can help us to build back a better and fairer country — one with fewer victims and safer streets.

This will be an investment in our future and a price worth paying.

08/09/2019,Plans to expand the team of cost-recovery experts will help recover millions of pounds in costs for treating overseas visitors in the NHS.,"
    
          Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock has announced plans to  expand the NHS’s existing team of cost-recovery experts, backed by £1 million.

Since 2018, a dedicated team of cost-recovery experts has been established to work with trusts. The expansion of this team will help the NHS to reclaim outstanding debts from overseas visitors who are required to pay for their care. These experts will work with existing cost-recovery managers in NHS trusts to:

provide additional time and human resource to help identify patients who should be charged, easing the administrative burden and speeding up the process
  ensure the rules and exemptions are universally understood and consistently implemented in hospitals across the country, including making clear that urgent treatment should never be withheld
  help improve the reporting of income and debt collection, ensuring chargeable tourists pay debts in full
The team will also help the NHS understand and implement the charging rules and processes for EEA visitors and migrants as part of preparations for leaving the EU. After Brexit, EEA nationals living lawfully in the UK can continue to use the NHS as they do now.

The NHS has already made progress in ensuring patients not ordinarily resident in the UK are identified and charged appropriately for access to NHS services, recovering more than £1.3 billion since 2015. However, there is still a significant amount of unpaid debt.

Only people who are ordinarily resident in the UK are eligible for free care, with non-EEA visitors required to pay a health surcharge when they apply for a visa to live temporarily in the UK. 

The government remains committed to protecting the most vulnerable people in our society, including refugees, asylum seekers, victims of modern slavery and children cared for by local authorities.

NHS rules state that trusts must never withhold treatment from patients who require urgent healthcare while they are in the UK, even if they cannot afford to pay. This means any care clinicians say should not wait until a visitor’s departure from the UK, and recovery of charges can take place after the care has been provided. Where treatment is non-urgent and it can wait until they leave the UK, it must not be provided unless fully paid for in advance.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:


  Our beloved NHS is renowned around the world for providing high quality health care and it is able to do so thanks to the valuable contributions made by hardworking taxpayers - so it is only fair we ask overseas visitors to pay their way as well.

  Today, we’re backing the NHS and giving them the support and the tools they need to ensure the rules are applied fairly and consistently.

  This new drive will help recoup millions in unclaimed funds for our NHS which can go back into frontline patient care, so the NHS can be there for all of us when we need it most.


Jason Dorsett, Chief Finance Officer, Oxford University Hospital Foundation Trust said:


  We have had huge support from NHSI’s overseas visitors improvement team. Being part of the programme, we have learnt alternative ways to identify chargeable overseas patients.

  The implementation of digital tools has reduced the administrative burden on previous methods resulting in a rise of income and cash recovery. We would recommend other Trusts if given the opportunity to be a part of the programme.

13/01/2020,The government is collaborating with pharmaceutical company Novartis to launch a clinical trial for new cholesterol treatment.,"
    
          
    Collaboration to offer cutting-edge new cholesterol treatment to tens of thousands of patients at risk of heart disease in coming years
  
  
    In a ground-breaking, in-principle agreement with Novartis, introduction of inclisiran on the NHS following approval has the potential to save up to 30,000 lives over the next 10 years
  
  
    Innovative manufacturing research collaboration will position the UK as a world-leading destination to develop cutting-edge treatments
  
Up to 30,000 lives could be saved over the next decade thanks to a proposed pioneering government collaboration with pharmaceutical company Novartis to tackle heart disease – a leading cause of death in the UK.

The yet to be approved drug inclisiran, a treatment to lower cholesterol, will be studied in UK patients as part of a large-scale NHS clinical trial expected to start later this year. Additionally in a world-first, the drug is expected to be available through a population-level agreement – pioneering a game-changing approach to reducing the risk of heart disease.

Early results from clinical trials suggest that if inclisiran is given to 300,000 patients annually, it could help prevent 55,000 heart attacks and strokes, and has the potential of saving 30,000 lives in the next 10 years.

Heart disease is the world’s biggest killer and the second biggest cause of death in the UK, with over 3 million people suffering from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 2 and a half million currently relying on statins to lower their cholesterol. Recent trials have shown inclisiran can halve bad cholesterol in just 2 weeks.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:


  As Health Secretary, I’m determined find ways to save as many lives as possible, and to do my best to stop terrible conditions like heart disease from taking people from their family and friends far too soon.

  This partnership is fantastic news and is a huge stride forwards in helping to achieve this. This collaboration has the potential to save 30,000 lives over the next 10 years and is proof that the UK continues to be the world-leading destination for revolutionary healthcare.

  I will always help the NHS reach its full potential, and novel and innovative collaborations such as this put patients at the forefront of the most promising medical breakthroughs.


Inclisiran, a bi-annual injection, is expected to be filed for approval as a preventative add-on treatment to statins for patients who have already been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease later this year.

It will also be put through the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence’s (NICE) approval programme at the earliest opportunity possible and NHS England will agree a population-level commercial arrangement with the company to make it widely available to patients as soon as 2021.

The agreement will make a significant contribution towards meeting the NHS Long Term Plan commitment to preventing 150,000 cardiovascular deaths over 10 years.

The collaboration between Novartis, NHS England, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), and Oxford University represents an innovative approach to tackling major public health issues and positions the UK as a world-leading destination to develop revolutionary medicines.

The innovative collaboration will be announced today (Monday) by the Chair of NHS England Lord Prior at the J.P. Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco.

Lord Prior, chair of NHS England, said:


  This innovative and groundbreaking collaboration could transform the health outlook of tens of thousands of people suffering from heart disease, by bringing together in a unique combination our ability to organise large scale clinical trials, to address highly complex manufacturing issues, and to reach a large population of patients.

  It is a great illustration of how the UK Life Sciences Strategy can help both NHS patients and the wider economy, and shows that the UK can be the centre of a dynamic life sciences ecosystem whilst delivering great care.


The collaboration also includes the creation of an industry and academic consortium to improve the efficiency in which the UK can manufacture for this form of innovative medicine.

The unique population health model used by the UK will enable the collaboration to address the needs of patients and health systems that have previously not been able to be met on a large scale. The new cost-effective process will lead the way for innovative approaches to helping meet large-scale, public health concerns.

This highlights the UK as a prime destination to get new medicines to patients faster and more cost-effectively. Its appetite for innovation, unrivalled infrastructure and world-leading joined-up healthcare system offers the opportunity for similar deals to be done for other drug development projects of this scale.

The UK plans to remain at the forefront of the global life sciences industry, giving our NHS and patients faster access to innovative medicines while supporting the growth of the sector.

Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said:


  Novartis has a unique opportunity with Inclisiran to use innovative population based approaches to open up a new chapter for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, the world’s leading cause of mortality and disability.

  Novartis is excited to partner with the UK government to leverage innovative models that could potentially lead to generating leading scientific evidence, accelerate access for patients and ensure continuous improvement in manufacturing efficiency and optimization.


Professor Sir John Bell said:


  The discovery and development of Inclisiran marks an important change in the approach to pharmaceutical interventions for public health. This program has introduced the use of health care system data from the NHS to dramatically reduce costs by rapidly identifying patient populations through health records.

  I am excited by this collaboration which is likely to have far-reaching impact on the way population level disease therapies are developed in the life sciences sector.


Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Oxford Martin Landray said:


  This trial provides an opportunity to demonstrate how a highly streamlined trial can be conducted within the UK by combining elements of patients already diagnosed cardiovascular disease and received treatment through the successful ORION-4 trial with the high-throughput clinics developed for UK Biobank.

  The trial will provide both a very reliable test of the efficacy and safety of inclisiran to support a population-health approach to the management of cholesterol, and act as an exemplar for future trials of other treatments in the UK.


Background information

Over the past decade, the pharmaceutical industry has largely stopped finding solutions for large public health issues, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity, due to the large costs developing new treatments.
  The UK is paving the way to overcome this by making development, manufacturing and route to market faster, cheaper and more efficient for all parties.
  This deal is an example of how the UK can facilitate large-scale prevention trials by addressing early on, the issues of implementation and manufacturing through research funded by government.
  This inclisiran study is being supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), the nation’s largest funder of health and care research, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care.
  Through the Clinical Research Network, the NIHR supports the planning, set-up and delivery of high quality clinical research with a network of experts across 30 specialties embedded across the NHS across England. Providing £300 million of support each year, NIHR CRN support is available to all studies meeting DHSC criteria, regardless of location, study type, or therapy area. It does this through meeting the costs of additional staff, facilities, equipment and support services and through a vast range of national and local resources that support health and care organisations, staff, and patients and the public to take part in research.
  The current Memorandums of Understanding (MOU), which form the basis of the proposal, were negotiated and signed by The Medicines Company prior to its acquisition by Novartis.
About ASCVD

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. ASCVD results from a thickening and loss of elasticity in the arterial wall. It is a severe disorder and the leading cause of morbidity (sickness) and mortality (death) in most developed countries. High levels of LDL cholesterol build up on the walls of blood vessels. This buildup is called ‘plaque’. As blood vessels build up plaque over time, the insides of the vessels narrow. This narrowing blocks blood flow to and from the heart and other organs and eventually causes heart disease or stroke.

About inclisiran

Inclisiran, potentially the first and only cholesterol-lowering therapy in the siRNA (small-interfering RNA) class, is an investigational twice-yearly therapy in Phase III clinical development. As a siRNA, inclisiran harnesses the body’s natural process of RNA interference to specifically prevent production of the PCSK9 protein in the liver, which enhances the liver’s ability to remove LDL-C from the bloodstream, thereby lowering LDL-C levels. Inclisiran is not yet approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority.


"
15/07/2019,Rehabilitation of offenders to be boosted by removing barriers to employment.,"
    
          

Adults no longer criminalised for life for nonviolent offences committed in childhood
  Changes will not apply to sensitive roles or most serious offenders


Ex-offenders striving to turn their lives around through work will be backed by new legislation changing what they must disclose to employers.

For the first time, some sentences of over four years will no longer have to be disclosed to employers after a specified period of time has passed. This change will not apply where offences attract the most serious sentences, including life, or for serious sexual, violent and terrorism offences.

Regular work is a major factor in breaking the cycle of crime but many ex-offenders find it impossible to get a job, with just 17% in employment a year after release from prison, and as half of employers would not consider hiring an ex-offender.

In addition to the rule change for longer sentences over four years, the period of time for which shorter sentences and community sentences have to be revealed to employers will be scaled back. The exact length of these ‘rehabilitation periods’ will be determined following discussions with stakeholders. 

The proposed reforms recognise that the longer someone goes without committing a further crime, the lower the risk they will reoffend.

Secretary of State for Justice, David Gauke, said:


  The responsibility, structure and support provided by regular work is an essential component of effective rehabilitation, something which benefits us all by reducing reoffending and cutting the cost of crime.



  That’s why we are introducing reforms to break barriers faced by ex-offenders who genuinely want to turn their lives around through employment.



  While these reforms will help remove the stigma of convictions, we will never compromise public safety. That is why separate and more stringent rules will continue to apply for sensitive roles, including those which involve working with children and vulnerable adults.


Currently, where a sentence of more than four years is passed, crimes committed decades earlier, including those committed as a child, must be disclosed to employers for the remainder of the offender’s life. For example, an individual sentenced to a lengthy sentence for theft half a century ago would still have to tell employers to this day. 

This creates a disproportionate barrier to employment which prevents ex-offenders from moving on with their lives.

In his review into the treatment of and outcomes for BAME individuals in the criminal justice system, David Lammy MP found that current rules are “trapping offenders in their past, denying dependents an income, and costing the tax-payer money.”

The Government has acted in light of his recommendations, as well as those of the Justice Select Committee and of Charlie Taylor made following his review of youth justice. The reforms set out will be introduced as new legislation when parliamentary time becomes available. 

They will only apply to non-sensitive roles, with separate and stricter rules for those working with children or vulnerable adults, as well as national security roles or positions of public trust. 

Notes to Editors

Detailed proposals on how we will amend the ‘rehabilitation periods’ for shorter custodial sentences and non-custodial sentences offences will be set out following engagement with stakeholders later this year.
  The rules for sensitive roles are subject to a recent Supreme Court judgment, to which the Government will respond later in the year. We are looking closely at this as we move forward with reforms to the disclosure regime.
  Only individuals who have stopped offending will have their convictions spent.
  If an individual reoffends during their rehabilitation period, they will have to disclose both their original and subsequent offences to employers for the duration of whichever rehabilitation period is longer.

08/04/2019,"Reforms coming into effect in April will support those who can work to get into employment, while ensuring there is a safety net in place for those who need it.","
    
          These include more generous work allowances for disabled people and families with children and extra financial support in the workplace through the government’s Access to Work scheme.

Other changes include increasing the State Pension, Maternity Allowance, most benefits for the additional cost of a disability and for carers, ensuring the government is supporting the most vulnerable.

The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Amber Rudd, said:

“Our benefits system must be an ally of the people it serves, ensuring we are supporting the most vulnerable and that work always pays.

“That’s why we’re bringing in a number of changes to put more money in people’s pockets, while protecting families, pensioners and disabled people. Our reforms are creating a fair compassionate society where everyone can reach their full potential, while maintaining a safety net for those who need it.”

1 April

Access to Work cap increase

People will now be able to claim up to an extra £2,000 a year to help pay for additional support that they may need in the workplace through the government’s Access to Work scheme, meaning the maximum annual grant is £59,200.

Access for Work can cover workplace adaptations, assistive technology, transport and interpreters.

6 April

Automatic enrolment into a workplace pension

To help workers to save for their future, the automatic enrolment pension contribution rates will increase from 5% to 8% on 6 April 2019.

Automatic enrolment was created to help people with their long-term pension savings and works by requiring employers to enroll all eligible staff into a workplace pension.

More than 10 million people are newly saving or saving more and the increase in minimum contribution rates will build on this success.

State Pension

The State Pension will also increase in line with the ‘triple lock’. The full basic State Pension will be up by 2.6% to £129.20 a week. This means that the Government will have raised the full basic State Pension by £1,640 a year since 2010.

The full rate of the new State Pension will also increase by 2.6%, to £168.60 a week.

8 April

Universal Credit Work Allowances

The amount which families with children and disabled people can earn before their Universal Credit is gradually reduced (work allowances) will increase, meaning that people can earn an extra £1,000 a year before their Universal Credit starts to reduce.

This change will see 2.4 million families keep up to an extra £630 per year of what they earn.

Maternity Allowance

Maternity Allowance may be paid to people who do not qualify for Statutory Maternity Pay. It can be claimed from the 26th week of pregnancy, and payments can start up to 11 weeks before the baby is due. Maternity Allowance will increase to £148.68 per week from £145.18.

Other changes coming into effect in April

Disability and carers’ benefit rates

Most of the benefits for the additional costs of disability and for carers have been increased by 2.4% in line with prices from 8 April.

The main rates for most working-age benefits in addition to Child Benefit, and certain elements of Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, will remain the same.

This is the final year of the 4 year benefit freeze announced at Summer Budget 2015.

National living Wage

The National Living Wage will increase by almost 5% to £8.21 per hour, benefiting 1.8 million workers from April.

Full–time workers earning National Living Wage will receive an additional £690 over the year and be more than £2,750 better off compared to 2015, when the rate was first announced.

06/02/2023,"£200 payments for off grid households start today, while businesses off the grid are expected to receive £150 payments by 10 March.","
    
          

£200 energy bill support to begin arriving with households off the gas grid across Great Britain
  businesses using alternative fuels will also start receiving £150 credit on bills– with payments expected to be delivered by 10 March
  new figures show £3 billion in government support has been paid out to businesses and public sector organisations in just over 3 months to support them this winter


From today households across Great Britain who don’t use mains gas for heating will start receiving £200 towards their energy bills as the Alternative Fuel Payment (AFP) scheme launches. Most will get the £200 AFP automatically as a credit on their electricity bill but some customers will need to apply for the support later this month.

Nearly 2 million households who use alternative energy sources such as heating oil, biomass and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to warm their homes will receive the support which was doubled to £200 last year.

The vast majority, including many homes in rural areas, will get it automatically through their electricity supplier as a credit on their bill throughout February. A small minority of customers, such as those living in park homes or on static houseboats with no direct energy supplier, will need to apply to receive the payment through an online portal that will launch later this month.

Meanwhile from Wednesday, energy suppliers will also be able to start making payments to businesses and both public and voluntary sector organisations that use alternative fuels to heat their buildings. A credit of £150 will be provided to eligible customers across the UK through the Non-Domestic Alternative Fuel Payment scheme (ND-AFP). Suppliers will deliver this support up to 10 March, with most customers expected to receive it later this month. There is no need to contact your supplier.

This comes as new figures show that, thanks to the government’s Energy Bill Relief Scheme, £3 billion has been cut from business energy bills in just over 3 months - helping both private and public sector organisations from schools, to hospitals and pubs.

Minister for Energy and Climate Graham Stuart said:


  Our main energy bill support schemes have seen millions of homes and businesses across the country get much needed help to cover costs, with figures today showing nearly £3 billion in government support has been paid out to business to date. Now we’re getting support to those remaining few that are off the gas grid and most difficult to reach.

  I am determined to see households and businesses of all stripes protected from global pressures this winter – whether that’s those living in a houseboat, park home or operating a rural hospital or school.

  That’s why we are kicking off payments of £200 to households using alternative fuel to heat their homes today - while businesses and organisations using alternative fuels will receive a boost of £150 in the coming weeks.


Ministers are today warning households to stay vigilant to scams and only to enter their details on the government’s gov.uk website, which will provide all official communications, if applying for support. No one will be asked for information by any individual or organisation prior to this or outside of the portal. Those that require additional help when applying for support may wish to seek assistance from a family member or trusted friend.

These schemes form part of a suite of energy bill support for domestic and non-domestic customers across the UK for winter 2022-2023.

On the domestic side, the Energy Price Guarantee is saving a typical UK household £900 over this winter by reducing the unit cost of electricity and gas, while the Energy Bills Support Scheme provides a further £400 off electricity bills through a monthly discount of £66 or £67. So the average family is saving £1300 altogether while more vulnerable households have received £800 on top of that as well - making a £2100 saving.

Businesses and other non-domestic customers are also benefiting from government support on a comparable basis. The Energy Bill Relief Scheme provides a direct subsidy of wholesale electricity and gas prices until the end of March, protecting jobs in charities and businesses alike. This will then be replaced by the Energy Bills Discount Scheme from April, which will offer universal support albeit at a reduced rate to protect the public finances.

Notes to editors

Domestic Alternative Fuel Payment

Domestic AFP support was doubled to £200 in the Autumn Statement to help with rising fuel costs. Automatic payments will appear as a credit on bills and start from 6 February. They are expected to be completed within the month - although this will depend on customers’ suppliers and how they pay their bills.

A small minority of customers, including those living in park homes or on houseboats with no direct electricity supplier, will need to apply to the domestic AFP Alternative Fund to receive payment. An application portal on gov.uk will open later in February, alongside further information on which households will need to apply. Those on the gas grid but without a gas connection and using alternative fuels as their main heating source will also likely need to take this route.

Customers should take no action until the online portal launches later in February. The application process will require customers to enter their household bank details onto the gov.uk portal. Customers will not be asked for details by any individual or organisation prior to this or outside of the portal, and any such contact is likely to be a scam. If you require additional help when applying for your AFP support, you may wish to seek assistance from a family member or trusted friend.

Non-domestic Alternative Fuel Payment

Last year the government committed to providing businesses and other non-domestic energy customers using alternative fuels with support equivalent to the Energy Bill Relief Scheme. This includes shops, offices, libraries, schools, hospitals, factories, and farms, among others. A credit of £150 will be provided to eligible customers across the UK through the Non-Domestic Alternative Fuel Payment scheme (ND-AFP).

The government has today issued instructions to electricity suppliers on how to deliver this support to eligible customers. Credits will be delivered by 10 March, with most businesses expected to receive it later this month.

Electricity suppliers will be provided with a list of households eligible to receive support under the Alternative Fuel Payments (AFP), identifiable by their Meter Point Access Number (MPAN).


MPANs are unique codes assigned to everyone’s electricity supply. The government determined whether an MPAN was eligible by taking a list of all domestic MPANs and removing those which are on the gas grid or where the local area predominantly uses electricity for heating
  households eligible to receive £200 AFP have been determined using:
    GB post codes where there is no active gas meter connection as of 13 December 2022
      mapping active GB post codes to Lower layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) using ONS National Statistics Postcode Lookup
      census data on heating type
      the MPAN report produced by the Retail Energy Code (REC), which will be accurate as of February 2023.
    
The AFP Alternative Fund application portal will open later in February. The application process will require households to provide their bank details – any direct request for your bank details from any individual or organisation is very likely a scam and should not be responded to.

02/09/2022,Waitrose has agreed to rewrite several property deals after it signed land agreements which blocked other supermarkets from opening nearby.,"
    
          

Waitrose re-writes land deals to allow rivals to open nearby
  “We will continue to take action when our rules are broken”, says CMA’s Adam Land


Waitrose admitted to a total of 7 breaches of the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 between 2010 and 2019 after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) took a closer look at how supermarkets were competing. The Order was brought in by the CMA to ensure supermarkets cannot use restrictive terms to prevent rivals from opening stores.

By helping supermarkets to compete freely, the Order aims to ensure that shoppers have more choice and so benefit from a wider range of groceries and access to cheaper prices – which is even more important as the cost of living rises.

To comply with the Order, Waitrose has agreed to remove restrictions from land agreements which prevented rivals from setting up new stores.

The 7 breaches relate to the following locations, where Waitrose operate existing stores:

Bromsgrove
  Rustington
  Swindon
  Daventry
  Chester
  Notting Hill Gate
  Market Harborough
Adam Land, Senior Director of Remedies at the CMA, said:


  It’s disappointing that Waitrose has acted against the interests of shoppers, despite these rules having been in place for over 10 years.

  Families across the UK are facing the rising cost of living. Preventing other supermarkets from opening new stores could stop people saving on their weekly shop.

  Waitrose is now putting this right so that everyone gets a fair deal. We will continue to take action when our rules are broken, and we have asked all supermarkets to show us their land deals comply with the Order.


The announcement today follows similar changes from Tesco in 2020 after the CMA found it had breached the same rules 23 times.

Notes to editors


    The CMA’s letter sent to Waitrose is publicly available and sets out the CMA’s responseis to the seven breaches reported by the supermarket.
  
  
    The CMA’s assessment of land deals by other supermarkets covered by the Order is ongoing.
  
  
    While the CMA does not currently have the power to fine those who breach the Order, the government is currently considering giving the CMA these powers.
  
  
    The Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 banned new restrictive covenants, which prohibit a piece of land from being used for a supermarket, when it came into force in 2010.
  
  
    The Order also banned Exclusivity Arrangements (which prevent landlords from allowing competing stores in the same block as an existing supermarket) which were over 5 years long.

16/06/2022,"The Environment Agency has completed additional flood defence work in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, to alleviate issues around the A38 at Branston.","
    
          The work, which started last summer in 2021, reduces flood risk to some 397 properties, including 18 affected by the flood of February 2020.  The whole investment in Burton, including £2 million from the National Highways Designated Funds programme, has cost over £30 million, and reduces the risk of flooding to over 4,600 homes and 1,000 businesses.

The A38 at Branston and adjacent properties have experienced flooding on several occasions since 2000. An investigation revealed that when the level of the River Trent was high, water got into Severn Trent Water’s foul sewerage system, highway drains and through low ground and eventually flooded properties and the highway.

Through the construction of sheet piled walls, embankments and non-return valves, water will now be contained in Tatenhill Brook when the River Trent is high.

Will Groves, Senior Flood Risk Adviser for the Environment Agency, said:


  This latest completed work has been funded from the £30 million set aside to improve the flood defences in the Burton-upon-Trent area.

  We want to thank all members of the local community for their understanding and patience while these works have taken place.

  Our team first started construction work in Burton in 2019 and the improved flood defences have already successfully protected properties, which otherwise would have been affected by floods, in the last two years.

  While these defences should provide reassurance to communities and businesses, no one should have a false sense of security. We strongly urge people to sign up for flood warnings and regularly check flood risk via our website


Ian Doust, National Highways Programme Development Manager, said:


  We are committed to reducing flooding on our roads and also minimising flood risks to the communities who live alongside them.

  In response to the changing climate, we are investing in schemes such as this which will improve the flood resilience of our network and reduce the flooding risk to our neighbours.

  It is extremely rewarding to see the completion of this scheme which will not only protect our roads and people living alongside them for generations to come but in the future will also enhance the waterside habitats enabling wildlife to thrive.

17/05/2022,"The government’s goal to see one million more disabled people in work has been reached, the latest official figures show.","
    
          Over one million more disabled people are in employment compared to five years ago according to the latest ONS (Office for National Statistics) data released today (Tuesday 17 May), confirming the government has achieved a key ambition in its efforts improve the lives of disabled people.

The latest figures show the number of disabled people in employment has increased by 1.3 million since 2017, delivering on a government goal to see one million more in work by 2027.

The 10-year employment goal was a government manifesto commitment originally set in 2017 to break down barriers for disabled people and those with health conditions and to build more diverse and inclusive workforces.

Welcoming the milestone and recognising that more can be done, the Minister for Disabled People will tomorrow (Wednesday 18 May) open a Disability Confident jobs fair at Hillman Street Jobcentre in Hackney, East London.

The event has been set up to give jobseekers with disabilities the chance to meet local employers, support groups and work coaches to help them access work and training opportunities that meet their career goals, as work is the best way for people to get on and improve their lives.

Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work Chloe Smith MP said:


  This is an important milestone showing our commitment to supporting disabled people to lead independent lives and reach their full potential.



  Ensuring everyone has the same opportunity for a fulfilling working life is a key part of levelling up the country and we will continue to push for greater accessibility and inclusion for disabled jobseekers.


There are a range of government initiatives, including schemes in partnership with the health system, to support those with disabilities and health conditions to live independent lives and to start, stay and succeed in employment.

One of these, the Disability Confident scheme, helps employers create more accessible and diverse workforces by championing inclusive recruitment practices. The scheme, which covers 11 million paid workers, helps employers think differently about disability, and improve how they attract, recruit and retain disabled workers. Ford, Sainsbury’s, Hilton and Coca-Cola are among the thousands of organisations across the UK signed up to the scheme aimed at boosting the number of disabled people in work.

Over the next three years, the government will invest £1.3 billion in employment support for disabled people and people with health conditions. This money will go toward building up existing provision, including expanding employment support, to grow the economy and help people with the cost of living.

Support into employment will also be an important theme within the DWP’s Health and Disability White Paper, due to be published later this summer, and it will outline further detail about how the £1.3 billion investment will be spent.

19/05/2020,Criminals who commit alcohol-fuelled crime may be banned from drinking and made to wear ‘sobriety tags’ after new legislation comes into force today (19 May 2020).,"
    
          

ankle tags to monitor offenders’ alcohol intake
  drinking could see offenders returned to court for further sanctions
  national rollout to begin later this year after successful pilots


The ankle tags, which are to be rolled out across England and Wales, perform around-the-clock monitoring of an offender’s sweat to determine whether alcohol has been consumed. If they drink – breaching their alcohol abstinence order – they can be returned to court for further sanctions. These might range from a fine, extending the length of the order or in some cases imprisonment.

It follows 2 successful pilots, one across Humberside, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire, and another in London, which showed offenders were alcohol free on 97% of the days monitored.  Wearers also reported a positive impact on their lives, wellbeing and behaviour.

Courts will be able to order offenders to wear a tag for up to 120 days. The tough community sentence not only punishes offenders but aids their rehabilitation by forcing them to address the causes of their behaviour –  in turn helping to reduce alcohol-related harm.

A national rollout will commence later this year.

Crime, Policing and Justice Minister Kit Malthouse MP said:


  Alcohol-fuelled crime blights communities and puts an unnecessary strain on our frontline services.

  Smart technologies like sobriety tags not only punish offenders but can help turn their lives around.

  While prison will always be the right place for many criminals, tough community sentences like this can help cut reoffending and protect the public.


Keith Hunter, Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Humberside, said:


  I welcome the use of the alcohol tags being rolled out across England and Wales. During the trial in our area they provided rehabilitation agencies a real opportunity to work with the individual and get them to recognise and change their behaviour.

  Undoubtedly their use will help reduce the number of victims of alcohol-related crime, many in domestic situations, and aid the rehabilitation of offenders as they become a standard feature of the Criminal Justice System.     

  This shows Humberside is at the forefront of influencing innovative Criminal Justice policy, shining a light on our area for the right reasons.


An estimated 39% of violent crime involves an offender under the influence of alcohol – with the social and economic cost of alcohol-related harm being £21.5 billion per year. 

The technology works by fitting a tag around the ankle of an offender. This then samples their sweat every half-hour to determine whether alcohol has been consumed. They can distinguish between alcohol-based products, such as hand sanitiser, that could be used to mask alcohol consumption and can detect when contact between the skin and the tag has been blocked.

An offender who wore one of the tags in the Humberside, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire pilot scheme and was managed by HLNY CRC said:


  Since I had the tag removed I feel 100% in control of my drinking. I was worried to begin with that when I had the tag taken off I might go back to drinking again but the process gave me a better understanding of alcohol.  I also didn’t want to go back to court.

  I no longer need a drink to manage my emotions which is down to the tag and my probation officer – I’m much happier with my life now and pleased that more people can benefit from my experience of wearing the tags.


The tags are a further example of using technology to better monitor offenders in the community and follow last year’s rollout of GPS tags that monitor an offender’s location 24/7.

It builds on government action to overhaul the criminal justice system – recruiting 20,000 new police officers, investing £2.75 billion in prisons and ensuring the most serious violent and sexual offenders spend longer in jail.

Notes to editors

The Ministry of Justice will start a national roll out of the Alcohol Abstinence Monitoring Requirement from Winter 2020.
  The tags will not be used on people who are alcohol-dependent or have certain medical conditions.
  The Ministry of Justice has supported two pilots of the Alcohol Abstinence Monitoring Requirement in London (MOPAC) and in Humberside, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire (HLNY). Findings for HNLY show that 94% of offenders successfully completed the requirement and compliance with the alcohol ban was 97.4% (HLNY), and for the MOPAC pilot 94% of offenders successfully completed the requirement with 98% days being alcohol free.
  The Crime Survey for England and Wales estimates that the proportion of violent incidents where the victim believed the offender(s) to be under the influence of alcohol, for year ending March 2018, was 39%.
  Public Health England estimate that the total social and economic cost of alcohol-related harm was £21.5 billion (2018).

20/05/2022,Biggest funding package in a generation to tackle youth offending and cut crime.,"
    
          

new ‘Turnaround’ scheme to catch troubled young people teetering on edge of criminality
  up to 20,000 more children and young people to be helped over next 3 years


Thousands of troubled children and teenagers teetering on the edge of crime will be put back on the right track thanks to the largest youth justice funding boost in a generation – cutting crime and making streets safer.

Around 80 percent of prolific adult offenders begin committing crimes as children, and the estimated cost of late intervention to the economy is nearly £17 billion per year.

That’s why the government is making the biggest investment in a generation – worth £300 million over the next 3 years – to support every single council across England and Wales in catching and preventing youth offending earlier than ever, helping to stop these children and teenagers from moving on to further, more serious offending.

And for the first time ever, local authorities will be given specific cash to intervene early with teenagers displaying signs such as poor school attendance, troubles at home, and a history of substance abuse which are known to be factors which often drive young people into crime – so they can steer them away from law-breaking before an offence is even committed.

Through ‘Turnaround’, a new early intervention scheme backed by £60 million, local Youth Offending Teams will be given extra funding to connect children and teenagers to targeted, wraparound support to stop them going down a path of criminality.

This could include mentoring, extra school tuition, sports clubs, help to address any issues at school or at home, with their mental health or with substance misuse, tackling the root causes of their behaviour and helping them to get their lives back on track.

Funding will also be used to bolster the day-to-day running of youth justice schemes and initiatives across the country, as well as support the work of the 20,000 additional police officers the government is committed to recruiting.

As part of today’s news, the Deputy Prime Minister, Dominic Raab, visited a community boxing scheme in Blackpool that is giving local children and teenagers an alternative to anti-social behaviour, giving them skills such as discipline and teamwork, and steering them away from potential offending and back into education and training.

Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor, and Secretary of State for Justice Dominic Raab said:


  Diverting more young people from gangs, drugs and violence will make our streets safer.
So, we’re investing £300 million in preventative initiatives, to deter criminal behaviour.

  Our plan will ensure thousands more young people can turn their lives around - which will transform their lives and make our communities safer.


Minister for Youth Justice Victoria Atkins said:


  Youth offending is a destructive force that blights communities and rips families apart.

  This vital new funding will help us stop youth crime in its tracks by ensuring these children stay in education and rebuild ties with their families, helping us build safer, more prosperous communities.


Youth Justice Board Chair Keith Fraser said:


  This is a smart and insightful investment by the government. If our youth justice teams are well-resourced to help children and families, we all benefit - from healthier, happier, safer children and from safer communities with fewer victims.

  This investment highlights the importance of their work and is a huge opportunity for youth justice teams across England and Wales. I hope they feel rightly proud of the contribution they make to the safety of communities and the lives of children.



Ministers estimate that the Turnaround programme will reach up to 20,000 more children over three years who would not otherwise have received support to turn away from offending.

While many local authorities already run successful early intervention programmes, by providing funding over a three-year period, councils will have greater certainty and be able to plan longer-term – ultimately steering more children and teenagers than ever away from crime.

Ministers will also set out plans in due course to improve how funding is targeted to local authorities, to ensure funding reaches areas who need it most and to ensure local authorities’ interventions are effective.

10/12/2021,"The people of Leicestershire are being invited to choose the name of its new jail in Glen Parva, Prisons Minister Victoria Atkins announced today (10 December 2021).","
    
          

community competition launched to name new prison
  more than 600 jobs to be created in boost to Leicestershire economy
  jail part of the government’s £4 billion programme to modernise prisons and cut crime


All residents are encouraged to send in name suggestions for the new 1,700-place jail, set to open in 2023, that embrace the history and culture of the area.

Earlier this week, the government set out its strategy on how modern jails – like the one in Glen Parva - will cut reoffending and protect the public by giving prisoners the education, skills and addiction support they need to live crime-free lives.

The development is part of a £4 billion programme that will see 20,000 additional prison places created by the mid-2020s.

The site has already created 230 jobs and 16 apprenticeships during construction and when open, it is expected to offer more than 600 jobs – providing a significant boost to the local economy.

Prisons Minister Victoria Atkins, said:


  We want our new, modern prison in Glen Parva to be rooted in its community. That’s why we are extending an invitation to local people to help choose its name.

  The prison will create hundreds of jobs when open - giving a major boost to the local economy and helping to protect the public.


The names will be narrowed down to a shortlist of potential options, with a panel of local representatives deciding on the final winner.

The name must then be formally agreed by Her Majesty The Queen, the Secretary of State for Justice Dominic Raab, and the Prisons Minister.

This follows a similar competition launched in Wellingborough (Northamptonshire), where another jail is due to open early next year.

In October 2020, it was revealed that ‘HMP Five Wells’ was chosen by the local community in Wellingborough, paying homage to the five historic wells surrounding the town and which appear on its coat of arms.

Construction of the new category C prison at Glen Parva began in August 2020 and is being built on the site of the previous HMP/YOI Glen Parva, which closed in 2017.

Note to editors

The scheme to name the new prison in Glen Parva is at no cost to the taxpayer.

14/12/2020,The Private International Law Bill (2020) received royal assent today (14 December 2020) allowing the UK to implement vital agreements which protect the country’s businesses and citizens across borders.,"
    
          

Bill allows UK to implement its own Private International Law agreements
  10-year strategy to capitalise on this new freedom published shortly


These agreements help to resolve a range of legal disputes – from returning children abducted by a parent, settling international business disagreements, to helping prevent a spouse living abroad dodging child maintenance obligations.

A public consultation on a 10-year strategy which seeks to capitalise on the UK’s regained capability in this area of law will be published shortly.

It will provide a blueprint for maintaining Britain’s status as a leading global jurisdiction for businesses to operate in, by giving them the legal certainty they need.  It will also ensure that consumers and families have access to the most effective ways of resolving disputes in an ever-more globalised world.

Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland said:


  These agreements provide vital protections to UK businesses, individuals and families looking to live, work, travel and trade across borders.

  We can now enjoy the freedom of being able to strike and implement our own Private International Law deals, ensuring they continue to have the interests of UK citizens at heart.


Without the ability to implement these agreements in domestic law, there could be parallel court cases in different countries, leading to conflicting decisions where UK individuals, businesses and families would bear the brunt of legal costs.

The Bill also maintains three key existing agreements, known as Hague Conventions, to ensure their clear implementation at the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, and will enable the implementation of the Lugano Convention 2007, should the UK’s application to re-join it be successful. 

It provides an overarching legislative framework, enabling individual private international law (PIL) agreements to be implemented via secondary legislation now the UK has left the EU.

Notes to editors

The Private International Law Bill (2020) received Royal Assent today. It allows the UK to secure its own Private International Law (PIL) agreements now the UK has left the EU.
  PIL agreements cover aspects of civil, family and commercial law, with a real and lasting impacts on people’s lives. PIL agreements could mean, for example
    child maintenance obligations imposed in one country can be recognised and enforced in another
      UK citizens can have confidence that if they travel, buy goods or have an accident abroad there is a way to resolve any legal disputes that may arise.
      businesses can feel confident entering into cross-border transactions, knowing that in the event of a dispute, there is a clear framework of rules for resolving it
      divorces can be recognised in other countries
      children abducted by one of their parents can be returned to their home country, and
      businesses can feel confident entering into cross-border transactions, knowing that in the event of a dispute, there is a clear framework of rules for resolving it.
    
  Beyond underpinning future deals, the Bill simplifies the implementation of three existing Hague Conventions at the end of the Transition Period:
    1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children: Helps resolve issues around residence and contact with children where parents live in different countries
      2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements: Offers legal certainty in some cross-border contractual disputes by deciding which court should hear a case and enabling the decision to be recognised and enforced in another country
      2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance: Guarantees international recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance across borders.
    
  A public consultation on a 10-year strategy for Private International Law will be published shortly.

12/03/2021,The CMA has today launched a study of children’s social care provision to establish why a lack of availability and increasing costs could be leading to the needs of children in care not being met.,"
    
          


    the study will examine the lack of availability and increasing costs in children’s social care provision, including children’s homes and fostering
  
  
    using its powers, the CMA is in a unique position to lift the lid on this complex sector and find solutions to problems it uncovers
  
  
    “Children’s care is not a market like any other - our clear and overriding priority will be about identifying ways children can get better care.” CEO Andrea Coscelli
  


The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will examine concerns around high prices paid by local authorities and inadequate supply of appropriate placements for children in their care. This could be putting pressure on the ability of local authorities to provide the appropriate accommodation and care which children need.

Using its statutory market study powers, the CMA aims to obtain information to help build a better understanding of the children’s social care sector. Depending on what it finds, it can issue guidance to businesses and the public, make recommendations to the industry or to government or, if appropriate, launch a full investigation into the market.

Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:


  Children in care are among the most vulnerable in our society and they need a system that does not let them down.



  We are concerned that some children are not getting access to the right placements due to a lack of availability in the system, and that rising prices are putting further pressure on stretched local authority budgets.



  The CMA is in a unique position to use its powers to look into this. But children’s care is not a market like any other - our clear and overriding priority will be about identifying ways children can get better care. This will include examining the concerns raised about the role of private sector providers, which has grown in the last few years, as well as the role of public and third sector providers.


In England, Scotland and Wales, around 99,000 children live under the care of their local authority. The majority of children in care, approximately 65,000, live in foster care. Around 16,000 children live in residential care, including children’s homes and independent or semi-independent living accommodation, with the remaining 18,000 in a range of other types of placement, including with their parents or placed for adoption.

Each local authority is responsible for contracting foster care and purchasing the required children’s homes places. Children are placed with foster carers, either directly by the local authority or by independent fostering agencies, which can be run for-profit in England and Wales but not in Scotland. Children’s homes are provided either directly by local authorities, by the private sector or by charities, with 70% of children in England and 78% of children in Wales placed in private sector homes.

The launch of the study comes after concerns have been raised by other organisations about private sector provision of children’s social care making high profit margins. A recent Local Government Association report found that some independent providers of children’s residential and fostering placements are achieving profits of more than 20% on their income. The study will examine whether high levels of profit have been made at the expense of investment in recruiting and retaining staff, and providing quality services.

The CMA will look at how well the current system of provision is working across England, Scotland and Wales and explore how it could be made to work better. In particular, it will look into:


    the supply of placements, including whether the current balance of local authority, private sector and third sector provision is working well for children and local authorities
  
  
    prices charged by providers and variation between prices paid for similar types of placement, with increasing prices potentially putting pressure on local authority budgets
  
  
    the way commissioning of places is carried out, and whether local authorities could be more effective in securing appropriate placements for children
  
  
    the environment for investing in the system to ensure sufficient appropriate places are available for all children who need them in the future, and whether any measures should be taken to improve this
  
In recent years, the CMA has carried out similar studies into funerals and care homes for older people, among others.

Comments on the issues raised can be submitted in the Invitation to Comment by 14 April 2021. All updates on the CMA’s work in this area can be found on the Children’s social care study page.

Notes for editors


    Market studies, like this one, may lead to a range of outcomes, including: (a) clean bill of health (b) actions which improve the quality and accessibility of information to consumers (c) taking consumer or competition law enforcement action (d) making recommendations to the government to change regulations or public policy (e) encouraging businesses in the market to self-regulate (f) making a reference for a more in-depth (phase 2) market investigation, or (g) accepting formal undertakings in lieu of a reference
  
  
    Costs charged to local councils for independent provision of children’s homes has increased by 40% from £2841 per week on average in 2013 to £3970 per week on average in 2019, according to data from the National Centre for Excellence in Residential Childcare.
  
  
    Recent reports by the NAO, HCLG Select Committee and Children’s Commissioner have been critical of public policy on children’s social care.
  
  
    The largest proportion of children’s homes places in England and Wales are provided by the for-profit sector – around 70% in England and 78% in Wales in February 2020. In England, there has been a 19% increase in for-profit provision since 2016 (based on 2019 data). In England and Wales, independent fostering agencies (IFAs) provide 18% of placements, but in Scotland it is prohibited to run a fostering agency on a for-profit basis.
  
  
    A report published in January 2021 by the Local Government Association and Revolution Consulting, Profit making and Risk in Independent Children’s Social Care Placement Providers, found that some large private providers were achieving profits of 20.6% on their income.
  
  
    The children’s social care system is the subject of significant policy attention across the UK, including through the independent review of children’s social care in England, the implementation of the Promise review recommendations in Scotland and the Improving Outcomes for Children programme in Wales. The CMA’s study will take into account the policy context of each nation.

03/12/2020,An extra £68 million will help thousands more disabled people to access grants to improve their homes so they can live independently.,"
    
          

Extra £68 million to help adapt homes for people with disabilities in England
  More than 280,000 home adaptions provided through the Disabled Facilities Grant
  Details of £4 billion Better Care Fund confirmed to better integrate health and social care


An extra £68 million will help thousands more disabled people to access grants to improve their homes so they can live independently, Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing Kelly Tolhurst has announced today (3 December 2020), the International Day of People with Disabilities.

The additional funding for councils will help people make the adaptations they need to live safely and independently in their own homes.

The Disabled Facilities Grant funding can be used towards the costs of home adaptations such as stair-lifts, level access showers, wet rooms, winches, grab rails and ramps. These can play a critical role in avoiding the need for hospital or care home admission, as well as helping to speed-up discharge from hospital.

This funding is in addition to the £505 million paid to councils in May 2020, increasing the overall government investment in the Disabled Facilities Grant to £573 million this year.

With Spending Review 2020 investment of £573 million in the Disabled Facilities Grant for 2021 to 2022, government has now confirmed over £4 billion funding for the grant since 2010.

This is part of the government’s comprehensive programme to better integrate health and social care services. Today details of the £4 billion Better Care Fund were also confirmed – setting out how councils may use this funding to deliver effective care and support for people in their communities.

Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Kelly Tolhurst said:


  I’m pleased that extra funding announced today, on the International Day of People with Disabilities, will see thousands more people benefit.  This grant can be literally life changing and lengthening, helping more people to live independently in their own homes.

  Since 2012 over 280,000 home adaptions have been funded through the Disabled Facilities Grant Scheme helping many tens of thousands of people to live at home independently.


Minister for Care, Helen Whately said:


  This grant will help hundreds of thousands of disabled people across England to live more independently in their own homes and improve their quality of life.

  I know this year has been incredibly difficult for disabled people in particular and I’m pleased that, on the International Day of People with Disabilities, we’re able to provide this additional funding.

  The Disabled Facilities Grant is a really important part of our ambition to reduce health inequalities and support more people to live healthy, independent lives for as long as possible.


The Disabled Facilities Grant forms part of the Better Care Fund, a fund which brings together local government and health partners to jointly plan and pool budgets to support integrated care.

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how health and social care systems can come together and focus on the public’s health and care needs. This announcement is part of the government’s ongoing work to address disparities across society, and its commitment to ensuring that health and care systems work effectively together at a local level, and the Better Care Fund is a key part of this integration.

08/11/2020,"Children and families will get extra support this winter, with councils given new funding to ensure vulnerable households do not go hungry or without essential items.","
    
          £170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme to support children, families and the most vulnerable over winter
  Holiday Activities and Food programme to be expanded, covering Easter, Summer and Christmas in 2021
  Healthy Start payments set to rise from £3.10 to £4.25 a week from April 2021
  Suite of measures represents long-term plan to help tackle poor health, hunger and education.
Building on the significant support given to the most vulnerable during the pandemic, a new £170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme will be run by councils in England.

The funding will be ring-fenced, with at least 80% earmarked to support with food and bills, and will cover the period to the end of March 2021. Local Authorities will receive the funding at the beginning of December 2020.

It will allow councils to directly help the hardest-hit families and individuals, as well as provide food for children who need it over the holidays. Local councils understand which groups need support, and are best placed to ensure appropriate holiday support is provided – which is why they will distribute the funds, rather than schools, who will continue providing meals for disadvantaged children during term-time.

The Holiday Activities and Food programme, which has provided healthy food and enriching activities to disadvantaged children since 2018, will also be expanded across England next year.

It will cover Easter, Summer and Christmas in 2021, and cost up to £220m. It will be available to children in every local authority in England, building on previous programmes – including this summers, which supported around 50,000 children across 17 local authorities.

Healthy Start scheme payments are also set to increase from £3.10 to £4.25 a week from next April, 2021.

This scheme supports pregnant women or those with children under four who have a low income and are in receipt of benefits to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. This will help people boost the long-term health of their children.

The Government has also pledged additional funding of £16m for food distribution charities, with conversations with FareShare and others ongoing as to how this is allocated.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said:


  We want to make sure vulnerable people feel cared for throughout this difficult time and, above all, no one should go hungry or be unable to pay their bills this winter.



  We know this has been a challenging time for many, and we have consistently supported the lowest-paid families, protecting 9 million jobs with furlough and boosting welfare support by £9.3 billion.



  This package builds on that support, and by extending our successful Holiday Activities and Food programme, as well as funding a £170 million Covid Winter Grant Scheme, we are making sure families get the help they need.


The government has acknowledged that school holidays can be difficult for some families, with children at risk of missing out on healthy meals, activities, and learning opportunities.

For example, learning loss over summer accounts for almost two-thirds of the attainment gap between the richest and the poorest children by age 14.

For this reason, up to £220m is being invested in the Holiday Activities and Food programme, with disadvantaged children able to get healthy food and take part in fun enriching activities over summer, Christmas and Easter in 2021.

Ministers have also taken unprecedented measures during the pandemic to protect the most vulnerable, and put in place a strong package of financial support to support families and children.

This includes:

Protecting millions of jobs and livelihoods through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, which have been extended until March 2021
  Increasing Universal Credit and Tax Credits by up to £20 a week this year
  £63m for councils to provide emergency assistance to families, pensioners and the most vulnerable with food, essentials and meals
  Extending free school meals support to those eligible when schools closed during lockdown
  Increasing Local Housing Allowance rates for Universal Credit and housing benefit claimants, so it covers the lowest 30% of local rents – benefiting over 1 million households by on average £600 this year.
Local authorities understand which groups need support, and are best placed to ensure appropriate holiday support is provided – which is why the £170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme will be distributed by them, rather than schools, who will continue providing meals disadvantaged children during term-time.

18/02/2021,Thousands of offenders will be diverted away from crime by the expansion of a catering training scheme in prisons across England and Wales.,"
    
          

the Clink Kitchens training programme to expand to up to 70 prisons
  training reduces reoffending rates by 32% and will transform the lives and prospects of thousands of offenders
  part of government’s commitment to build back safer by cutting reoffending, which costs the taxpayer £18 billion a year


Over the next 3 years, Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) and The Clink charity have agreed to extend their training programme, currently already operating in HMPs High Down, Cardiff, Brixton and Styal, to offenders working in an additional 70 prison kitchens.

Following successful pilots, training will continue at HMPs Bristol and Styal and from the end of April they will be first joined by Eastwood Park, Send and Downview with a steady further rollout creating opportunities to help as many as two thousand offenders into employment and away from crime for good.

Boosting access to work and safe accommodation for prison leavers will also help build back safer communities by cutting crime and reducing reoffending, which costs the taxpayer £18 billion each year.

Prisons Minister Lucy Frazer MP, said:


  This expansion of the catering programme is testament to the thousands of training and job opportunities it has provided for offenders over the years.

  Cutting reoffending and its vast cost to society is a priority for this government. Training within prison leads to employment on release, which we know has such a positive impact on ex-offenders, their families and communities, and ultimately reduces crime.


The Clink’s training scheme is proven to significantly cut rates of reoffending, with offenders 32% less likely to go on to commit further crimes compared to those who did not receive training.  This success means for every £1 invested, The Clink Charity is likely to generate at least £4.80 back to the prison service, government and society in reduced reoffending rates.

The expansion to more prisons marks a new era for the partnership with HMPPS, which over a decade has helped more than 2,500 ex-offenders find employment.

The training sees serving prisoners work in professionally run kitchens for up to 35 hours a week, preparing and cooking up to 80,000 daily meals for fellow prisoners. Trainees will work towards gaining City and Guilds National Vocational Qualifications Levels 1, 2 and 3, while improving their confidence, teamworking and communication skills.

The scheme will be funded entirely by The Clink through generous donations from many organisations and supporters.

Finlay T K Scott, Chairman of The Clink Charity said:


  Reducing crime and improving all of our lives is at the heart of what The Clink does. This latest initiative in partnership with HMPPS underlines the tremendous impact The Clink program has had over the last ten years.

  We will build upon the success of our innovative integrated program and roll it out across the prison estate. This platform will dramatically increase the number of students we are able to rehabilitate with the subsequent impact upon reoffending figures.


The partnership with The Clink Charity is one of many government schemes aimed at supporting offenders into employment with the ultimate aim of cutting crime. Other initiatives include work placements for dozens of offenders as the construction of HMP Five Wells gets underway, as well as the new prison at Glen Parva.

Notes to editors

Justice Data Lab figures show the rate of reoffending for prisoners who participated in the scheme was 15%, compared to 22% for those who did not. This is a difference of 32%.
  Over the next 3 years New Futures Network, the specialist part of HMPPS which works to create employment opportunities for serving prisoners and prison leavers, will help The Clink deliver their sector-led training program. The Clink Charity is unique as it not only delivers training inside the prison but carries on with full support and mentoring post-release to help them reintegrate back into society, gain full-time employment and ultimately reduce reoffending.

  Range of specialist services, including drug and mental health support, will based under one roof


The hub, the first of its kind, will be based at Newham Probation Office and has been developed by the Ministry of Justice and the Mayor for London’s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).

Young adults have a particularly high risk of reoffending and are more likely to carry out drug, robbery and possession of weapons offences, and be caught up in gang crime.

Mental health and substance misuse experts will work alongside National Probation Service staff, as part of an innovative new approach ensuring vulnerable young adults, many of whom had troubled upbringings and poor education, receive the enhanced support they need to avoid a life of crime.

Offenders released without a home or a job are significantly more likely to reoffend, so accommodation, training and employment services will also operate from the hub to help cut crime.

This support is already available but bringing this range of services under one roof and tackling these complex issues together at an early stage can prevent thousands of people becoming victims each year and save some of the £18 billion annual cost of repeat crimes.

Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Robert Buckland, MP, said:


  This ground-breaking new model will help offenders get their lives back on the straight-and-narrow before it’s too late and they become career criminals.



  It will mean less reoffending and fewer people becoming victims of crime while also giving these young adults all the tools they need to make the most of their lives.


London’s Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Sophie Linden, said:


  It’s vital we do everything we can to prevent reoffending and give young people who have been through the criminal justice system the support they need to turn their lives around.



  We know the pandemic has meant fewer jobs and opportunities for our young people and that is why this new hub in Newham is so important. It will give us the platform to make vital interventions and deliver specialist support to vulnerable young people, helping them turn away from crime and rebuild their lives through access to housing, education and job opportunities.


The pilot will launch in July and run until March 2023 for 18-25 year olds who are assessed as having low levels of maturity and 17 year olds transitioning from the Youth Offending Service to adult probation. It will then be externally evaluated and, if a success at reducing reoffending and improving outcomes for this cohort, rolled out across the country.

All staff will receive specific training in the brain development of young people. Young adults have distinct needs, which are different to both older adults and children and treating them as a specific group will ensure the root causes of their offending are spotted and addressed earlier on in their development.

This £3 million of Government funding follows a £148 million investment to protect people from the scourge of illegal drugs and a £70 million package to support offenders into temporary accommodation upon release.

Taken together, this £220 million of funding highlights the Government’s commitment to tackling crime.

23/01/2021,38 organisations will receive almost £2 million in government funding so their vital work steering women away from crime can continue.,"
    
          

around £2 million to support community services that work with vulnerable women
  cross-government agreement to reduce the number of women in the Criminal Justice System
  extra investment in prison places to improve conditions for women in custody


The funding comes as the government reiterates its commitment to reduce the number of women in custody and improve conditions for those that are serving time.

Over £5 million has already been invested in services supporting women in the criminal justice system since 2018. This latest funding will help cover running costs such as wages, rent and bills at a time when many charities have additional demand for their services due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Ministry of Justice has pledged to work alongside other government departments and public services such as the National Health Service and Public Health England to more effectively support vulnerable women in addressing the issues which can lead them to commit crimes, while up to 500 new prison places will be built in existing women’s prisons to improve conditions.

Lucy Frazer QC MP, Minister for Prisons and Probation said:


  This funding boost will allow frontline services to continue the incredible work they do with some of the most vulnerable women in our society to prevent them being drawn into crime.

  Many female offenders suffer complex issues and have experienced very traumatic lives - and it’s only by addressing this that we will break the costly cycle of reoffending.


The funding announced today (23 January 2021) will support organisations such as Shropshire based Willowdene, which was awarded nearly £60,000 and uses a mixture of therapy that addresses traumatic life experiences and work placements to rehabilitate women dealing with issues such as substance misuse and exploitation. A grant of £60,000 will allow Cheshire Without Abuse to continue its vital work with domestic abuse victims, as cases continue to rise during lockdown. These services play a crucial part in preventing women being drawn into crime and help reduce rates of reoffending for those that are. 

Dr Matthew Home, CEO of Willowdene Rehabilitation Ltd said:


  Referrals to our service have increased during lockdown, particularly for women leaving custody and aiming to complete a period of rehabilitation prior to going home. This funding will allow us to maximise the number of women we can help at any one time, as our core costs are covered through the grant.


While women who commit the most serious crimes will always be sent to prison, custody should always be a last resort. The number of women in custody has fallen by 10% since 2010 and government investment in community services should see this trend continue in the long-term. However, the recruitment of an extra 20,000 police officers is expected to cause a temporary increase in in the female prison population.

Up to 500 new places will be built in existing prisons to increase availability of single cells and improve conditions. These will include in-cell showers and will allow more women to be held in open conditions, providing greater opportunities for employment and education while completing their sentence. Some of the new places will also allow women to have overnight visits with their children to prepare for life back home. If, as expected, the female prison population falls longer-term, these modern facilities will allow the Prison Service to close old accommodation.

Around half of women in prison have a mental health issue and a similar proportion have a history of drug use. Dealing with these underlying issues can help reduce the chance of women entering the criminal justice system in the first place and reduce reoffending rates when they do.

This requires a whole host of different agencies, local and national, to work together to help each individual offender, whether that be, getting into addiction treatment, finding a stable home or escaping an abusive partner. This ‘whole-system approach’ gives women a better chance of turning their lives around and has been endorsed again by government today in the National Concordat on Female Offenders.  

The drive to cut offending by women also stands to benefit from the largest increase in drug treatment funding in fifteen years announced earlier this week. An extra £80 million is being invested in services across England to increase the number of treatment places for prison leavers and those diverted into tough and effective community sentences.

28/02/2020,"The CMA has found troubling evidence of potential mis-selling and unfair contract terms in the leasehold housing sector, and is set to launch enforcement action.","
    
          As part of a probe into the industry, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is concerned that leasehold homeowners have been unfairly treated and prospective buyers misled by housing developers.

These concerns include:


    Ground rents: homeowners having to pay escalating ground rents, which in some cases can double every 10 years. This increase is often built into contracts, meaning people can often struggle to sell their homes and find themselves trapped.
  
  
    Cost of the freehold: the CMA has seen evidence that people have been misled about the cost of converting their leasehold to freehold ownership. When buying their home, some people were told the freehold would cost only a small sum, but later down the line this price had increased by thousands of pounds with little to no warning.
  
  
    Misleading information: not being told upfront that a property is leasehold and what that means. Some developers are failing to explain the differences between leasehold and freehold when directly asked, and some actually tell potential buyers that there is no difference. By the time people find out the realities of owning a leasehold, including the regular charges to be paid, they are often unable to pull out of the purchase, or would face significant difficulties if they tried to do so.
  
  
    Unreasonable fees: being charged excessive and disproportionate fees for things like the routine maintenance of a building’s shared spaces or making home improvements. If people want to challenge such charges, the process is often difficult and costly, meaning few people decide to go through with it.
  
Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s Chief Executive, said:

“We have found worrying evidence that people who buy leasehold properties are being misled and taken advantage of.

“Buying a home is one of the most important and expensive investments you can make, and once you’re living there you want to feel secure and happy. But for thousands of leasehold homeowners, this is not the case.

“We’ll be looking carefully at the problems we’ve found, which include escalating ground rents and misleading information, and will be taking our own enforcement action directly in the sector shortly.”

The CMA is now completing all the necessary legal work to launch direct enforcement action against companies it believes have broken consumer protection law. This could result in firms signing legal commitments to change how they do business. If they fail to make the required changes, the CMA could take action through the courts to make them comply with the law.

The evidence found by the CMA also supports the case for changes to the law in this area. The CMA will continue to work with the Government on its reform plans for the leasehold market, including supporting the move to ban the sale of new leasehold houses and reduce ground rents for new leases to zero.

As part of its work, the CMA is developing consumer advice for people who own, or are looking to buy, a leasehold property. This will offer tips on what they can do when faced with permission fees and service charges they consider unjustified.

All information relating to this investigation can be found on the leasehold case page.

"
18/07/2019,Justice Secretary David Gauke today called for an “evidence-led” approach to tackling reoffending in order to crack down on crime and reduce the number of victims.,"
    
          

New research lays bare the social and economic cost of reoffending
  Reoffending now accounts for over three quarters of all crimes that result in a caution or sentence
  Fresh evidence suggests community sentences are more effective than short prison sentences


The intervention comes as new research reveals that repeat offenders cost society more than £18 billion a year - with reoffending now accounting for over three quarters of all crime that result in a caution or sentence.

Speaking to prominent criminal justice stakeholders, charities and front-line professionals, the Justice Secretary argued that the tide will only be turned by following an evidence-based approach and tackling the root causes of reoffending.

He revealed statistics which show that if all current custodial sentences of less than six months were replaced with community alternatives there would be around 32,000 fewer offences per year – drastically reducing the number of people becoming victims of crime.

Other findings in a number of research documents published today include:

64% of those in prison for six months or less have a drug misuse problem, compared with just over a third serving a community order;
  72% lack the skills and motivation to get or hold down a job, as opposed to 37% serving a community order;
  60% do not have a stable or suitable place to live; compared with 31% on a community order;
  The total social and economic cost of reoffending England and Wales is now estimated at more than £18.1 billion a year;
  More than half of those costs - some £9.8 billion - are related to theft offences, which are often driven by underlying problems such as substance misuse.
Speaking at an event hosted by the Social Market Foundation, Mr Gauke said:


  There is one stark fact facing us: three quarters of all crime that results in a caution or sentence happens because of reoffending. We must be fearless in dealing with this.



  Whilst long prison sentences will always be right for those who commit the most serious crimes, particularly of a violent or sexual nature, the fact is that the vast majority of all offenders will at some point be released.



  I believe the public therefore expect the justice system to focus on rehabilitation to reduce the risk of subsequent offending – and the likelihood of them becoming a victim of crime.


In February, the Justice Secretary set out his vision for a “smart, not soft” justice system to reduce reoffending, protect the public and ensure serious criminals receive the punishment they deserve. 

He spoke of the need to look beyond prison, move away from the revolving door of short custodial sentences and replace them with robust alternatives in the community that better target the root causes of offending.

Today, Mr Gauke pointed to new research which showed that those who serve short prison sentences often have very complex needs, which are better addressed through a community sentence.

He added:


  Those who are sentenced to six months or less spend, on average, just six weeks in prison. This just isn’t enough time for any meaningful rehabilitation to take place to successfully tackle these problems.



  Ultimately, that short spell in prison doesn’t protect the public, doesn’t serve as much of a deterrent and exacerbates those already deep-rooted difficulties the individual faces.



  So, this latest research has further reinforced my view that moving away from prison sentences of up to six months will deliver real and positive change, for the offenders to turn their lives around and for the safety of the public.


He said that there were different ways that this could be achieved:


  A bar to prevent the courts using them, or a less prescriptive presumption against their use. Or you could consider combining these options, applying a presumption to sentences of up to 12 months.



  I think there’s a strong case to explore this, given the evidence.


However, he was clear that there should be exceptions to any bar on short prison sentences, adding:


  Our first responsibility must be to the victims of crime and we should not do anything to compromise their safety. For this reason, a bar should not apply to offences of physical or sexual assault, so that in the right cases courts will be able to impose a short prison sentence.


He also emphasised the need to uphold the authority of the court:


  There are several offences which involve a disregard for court orders or its authority, where the possibility of a short prison sentence should be retained.



  For those repeat offenders who have been given community orders and who wilfully and persistently fail to comply with them, they need to know that they cannot get away with it with impunity.


In addition, he argued that consideration must be given to other offences which raise issues of public protection, where a short prison sentence should continue to be an option – for example, knife crime.

To underpin these reforms, Mr Gauke has overseen investment of hundreds of millions of pounds to improve prisons, boost rehabilitation, and overhaul the probation system to better support offenders in turning their backs on crime.

On probation, he said:


  Crucial to the success of any reform of sentencing is a strong probation system. Two months ago, I announced plans to reform our probation system, which will allow for much more robust community sentences and that will command the confidence of the courts.



  We will be ending Community Rehabilitation Company contracts early and streamlining responsibilities for public, private and voluntary sector partners.



  That means a stronger role for the National Probation Service in managing all offenders, greater voluntary sector involvement in rehabilitation, and the private sector leading where it has specialist experience and where it can support innovation in rehabilitating offenders and organising Unpaid Work placements.



  A strengthened probation system will significantly improve the services that have been shown to help turn offenders away from crime – be it housing support, help finding a job, or crucially, help to turn away from drink or drugs or treat mental health issues.


Mr Gauke also stressed the vital role new technology has to play in bolstering community orders, pointing to findings from a GPS tagging pilot which found that most offenders felt that wearing a tag would help them make positive changes in their lives.

Announcing plans to build on this success by rolling out a variation of this service for children in the autumn, he said:


  Technology, like GPS tagging, will help to give judges and magistrates more confidence to use community sentences in more cases.



  And I’m ambitious about what we can do in the future – using new technology and thinking innovatively about how we can be both punish and rehabilitate in the community.



  Through our probation reforms – and with some bold thinking about what community sentences look like in the future – we will see a successful shift away from ineffective short prison sentences towards more effective ways of rehabilitating offenders.


Mr Gauke also insisted that any approach must be based on safe, secure and decent prisons. He cited how the ‘Ten Prisons Project’, has focussed on improving standards in the most challenging prisons, alongside extra urgent funding and measures to tackle drugs and violence across the estate and significantly increasing the number prison officers.

He pointed to action aimed at boosting rehabilitation, such as the Education and Employment Strategy, putting education, skills and jobs at the heart of prison regimes. He said:


  As well as helping those in prison prepare for work, I have also been keen to remove barriers and tackle prejudice that ex-offenders all too often face in trying to get a job.



  As I announced this week, we intend to legislate so that for the first time, some sentences of more than four years will no longer have to be disclosed to employers after an appropriate period of time has passed.


Mr Gauke’s approach towards combatting reoffending has received significant backing by leading figures in the justice system, including PCCs, charities and organisations working with offenders.

Concluding his speech, Mr Gauke said:


  I believe that the approach that I’ve set out today – indeed the approach I have set out in the last 18 months – is one that is most likely to be effective in reducing reoffending and therefore reducing crime.



  I am aware that it is an approach that will not have universal support but I have taken great encouragement from the widespread support for an evidence-led, rehabilitative and humane agenda.



  It is my hope that in the years ahead – whoever has the privilege of being Justice Secretary – it is an approach that will be pursued with persistence and determination and courage. And that it will help deliver a safer and more civilised society.

29/09/2020,£27 million has been announced for mental health charity Think Ahead to expand their mental health social work graduate programme.,"
    
          Up to 480 mental health social workers will be recruited and trained – with applications open today (29 September)
  More than 10,000 people living with serious mental illness will receive support
More than 10,000 people living with serious mental illness will receive support from 480 new mental health social workers, thanks to a £27 million funding boost for the charity Think Ahead.

The new funding – which has been welcomed by mental health charity Mind – will help recruit and train a new wave of mental health social workers, who will form a vital part of the response to coronavirus. Applications for the graduate places have opened today.

The recruits are trained to provide psychological and practical support to help people with serious mental illness, such as severe depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and address issues such as relationships, housing and employment, which can have a huge bearing on mental wellbeing.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health – and recent research suggests that those with pre-existing mental health conditions are at greater risk of significant, long-term negative effects.[footnote 1]

This new funding will give the most vulnerable the support they need by expanding the Think Ahead programme by 60% – from 100 trainees each year to 160 – training up to 480 new mental health social workers across England over the next 3 years.

Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Nadine Dorries said:


  The impact of the pandemic on those with pre-existing mental health conditions could be significant and long lasting.

  The NHS, local services and charities have done an excellent job in being there to support those who have needed help throughout the pandemic, but it is vital that we ensure our services are fit to meet ongoing demand.

  By expanding the mental health workforce this new funding will boost support for the most vulnerable at a time when they need it most.


Think Ahead Chief Executive, Ella Joseph, said:


  We are delighted to be able to train hundreds more social workers, who will play a key part in the nation’s mental health recovery from coronavirus.

  The pandemic has shown us more than ever that social factors like isolation, relationships, finances and living arrangements have profound impacts on mental health – social workers are uniquely placed to help people with severe mental health problems to address issues like these.


The Think Ahead programme offers talented graduates and those looking to change career a paid route into frontline mental health services, run by the NHS and local authorities, with training delivered on the job in partnership with Middlesex University.

The programme, which began in 2016, has been a huge success, and so far has recruited over 500 mental health social workers. It is recognised in the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers list as one of the top 40 graduate schemes in the country, and receives more than 30 applications for each place.

Applications for the 2021 intake have opened today, with the selection process focusing on the motivation and skills to make a difference to vulnerable people.

Paul Farmer, Chief Executive of Mind, said:


  It’s great to see further funding for Think Ahead. The programme is supporting people who want to become mental health social workers and change the lives of people who experience serious mental health problems.

  People’s social circumstances – such as their finances, living arrangements and relationships – are crucial to good mental health. That has become even more clear this year as the coronavirus has had a deep impact on many people’s lives.


Claire Murdoch, NHS England’s National Director of Mental Health Director, said:


  Expanding mental health care for patients, including by boosting our workforce, is an important priority for the NHS so it’s absolutely good news that the Think Ahead programme is being enhanced, recognising that its trainees have already supported thousands of people across dozens of NHS mental health trusts in England.

  Mental health social workers have a vital role to play in helping to ensure that people receive the mental health and care support they need, as the NHS continues to deliver care to people who need it, as we have done throughout the pandemic.


Background information

Think Ahead

Think Ahead is an independent charity. Its flagship graduate programme, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care, offers talented graduates and career-changers a route to train on the job as mental health social workers.

To date the charity has recruited more than 500 new entrants for over 60% of England’s NHS mental health trusts and 30% of local authorities, across every region of England.

Today’s announcement

Think Ahead has been awarded a contract for up to £27 million from DHSC:

This contract will fund at least 2 more intakes of the 2-year programme, starting in summer 2021 and summer 2022, and costing just over £9 million each. The contract includes an optional extension to a third intake
  Each intake will recruit and train up to 160 social workers. This is a 60% increase in size, as previous intakes each took around 100 participants
  We estimate that recruits from the first 2 intakes (i.e. those guaranteed by the contract) will support at least 10,000 service users by 2025. This is a conservative estimate based on average numbers of service users that participants from our previous intakes have worked with
The impact of mental health problems

Mental illness affects 1 in 4 adults in England each year. It has the same effect on life expectancy as smoking, and overall costs the UK over £100 billion a year in healthcare and lost productivity. See more information on the national scale and effects of mental illness.

How the Think Ahead programme works

Think Ahead participants undergo an intensive 2-year programme that blends on-the-job experience with academic learning and leadership training. Participants become qualified after their first year on the programme, and complete a master’s degree during their second year.

Financial support

In the first year, participants receive a tax-free training bursary of £17,200 outside London or £19,100 inside London. In the second year, they are employed as a newly qualified social worker and receive a taxable salary. This will typically range from £21,000 to £33,000, depending on location.

Academic qualifications

Middlesex University leads Think Ahead’s teaching and curriculum (and awards the degrees to participants).

Selection process

Applicants must have (or be on course for) a 2:1 undergraduate degree in any subject. Candidates who meet the academic criteria go through a rigorous 3-stage assessment process focused on 7 key attributes, which includes a role-play social work situation and an interview with someone who uses mental health services.


  
      Research published by the Centre for Mental Health suggests that half a million more people in the UK may experience mental ill health as a result of COVID-19 (see the COVID-19 and the nation’s mental health report) and that those with pre-existing mental health conditions are at greater risk of significant, long term negative effects (see the COVID-19: understanding inequalities in mental health during the pandemic report). <U+21A9>

14/12/2020,Rough sleepers across England will receive extra support to help them recover from drug and alcohol misuse.,"
    
          

£23 million investment for 43 areas this year, boosted by a further £52 million in 2021 to 2022
  Initial £10 million funding confirmed to provide extra accommodation for rough sleepers throughout winter


Rough sleepers across England will receive extra support to help them recover from drug and alcohol misuse, Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Kelly Tolhurst MP announced today (14 December 2020).

Forty-three areas across England will receive support from a £23 million government fund designed for those with drug and alcohol support needs to get the help they need to rebuild their lives. The programme will be boosted by a further £52 million in 2021 to 2022.

Rough sleepers who are being provided with emergency accommodation during the pandemic as part of the government’s ‘Everyone In’ programme, and people who are currently rough sleeping, will be eligible for support.

In partnership with the Department of Health and Social Care, and managed by Public Health England, the funding will enable them to access drug and alcohol treatment, including detox and rehabilitation services.

This will be alongside wraparound support, such as access to mental health and substance dependence workers and peer mentors, who are key to working with vulnerable people in treatment services.

The minister has also confirmed an initial £10 million funding for 19 areas, plus the Greater London Authority, under the government’s £15 million ‘Protect Programme’. This is to provide accommodation for rough sleepers during the pandemic in areas that required extra support during the restrictions and throughout winter.

Taken together, government spending on rough sleeping and homelessness this year is over £700 million, with the ‘Everyone In’ campaign helping to protect thousands of lives during the pandemic by housing rough sleepers in safe accommodation.

Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Kelly Tolhurst said:


  We know that one of the main issues facing those sleeping rough, or at risk of homelessness, is misuse of drugs or alcohol and what a crippling effect these substances have on people’s lives.

  While our ‘Everyone In’ campaign has helped to protect thousands of lives, we still need to work hard to break the cycle of rough sleeping for good.

  This funding will provide thousands of vulnerable people with the support they need to get on the road to recovery to rebuild their lives away from the streets for good.


Health Minister Jo Churchill said:


  The need to support the most vulnerable groups in society has never been more important or more apparent than this year.

  We are committed to supporting those who want to break the cycle of addiction.

  This funding will not only help those personally fighting addiction, but also benefit their loved ones and the communities who suffer from the often very difficult consequences of substance misuse.


Rosanna O’Connor, Director of Drugs, Alcohol, Tobacco and Justice at Public Health England said:


  Those sleeping rough with substance misuse problems can find it difficult to access services that can help them - their health continues to deteriorate and it becomes harder for them to turn their lives around.

  This grant will help people who sleep rough struggling with addiction to improve their health and break this pattern and we are looking forward to seeing the positive impact this will have now and in the future.


Steve Douglas CBE, Chief Executive of St Mungo’s said:


  Our own Knocked Back research published earlier this year shows how it has become increasingly difficult for people sleeping rough to access the substance misuse services they need. We also found that drug overdoses were one of the main causes of death of people who do sleep rough.

  We are pleased that the government is targeting funding to tackle this urgent issue alongside other efforts to reduce the number of people sleeping on the streets.

  This year we have seen what is possible when a coordinated multi-agency approach to providing support is taken. And we at St Mungo’s will continue to work with national and local government, and our local partners, to build on these successes and enable as many people as possible to get the help and support they need to recover from homelessness.

15/05/2020,A new £600 million Infection Control Fund has been introduced to tackle the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in care homes.,"
    
          £600 million Infection Control Fund to reduce transmission of coronavirus in care homes
  This forms part of wider support for care home residents and staff, including by limiting staff movement, protecting wages and giving access to NHS personal protective equipment (PPE) training
  Each care home in England to be given a named clinical lead to provide direct care for residents
  A wellbeing package will be also launched on CARE Workforce app to support the workforce with Hospice UK and Samaritans
A new £600 million Infection Control Fund has been introduced to tackle the spread of COVID-19 in care homes in addition to £3.2 billion of financial support made available to local authorities to support key public services since the start of the crisis.

The fund, which is ringfenced for social care, will be given to local authorities to ensure care homes can continue to halt the spread of coronavirus by helping them cover the costs of implementing measures to reduce transmission.

Care homes will be asked to restrict permanent and agency staff to working in only one care home wherever possible. The funding could be used to meet the additional costs of restricting staff to work in one care home and pay the wages of those self-isolating.

Care home support package

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:


  This £600 million Infection Control Fund will help as we continue to reduce infections in care homes and save lives.

  From the very start of this outbreak, we have been working to protect our brilliant social care workforce and the most vulnerable in our society.

  Our package sets out clearly the extra steps local councils and care homes should be taking as we stamp out the spread of this virus.


In further measures announced today:

all local authorities must conduct a daily review of care homes in their area to ensure care homes have the support they need with staffing, help with accessing PPE and other areas of operation
  the NHS will ensure that each care home has a named clinical contact to provide better access to clinical advice through weekly check-ins to review their patients, and offer direct support for staff with use of equipment and medication
  a wellbeing package for social care staff is also being rolled out today on the new CARE app including 2 new helplines, led by the Samaritans and Hospice UK. This will help support care staff with their mental health and wellbeing and support those who have experienced a traumatic death as part of their work or help with anxiety and stress
Minister for Care Helen Whately said:


  Our care homes, and those working tirelessly to look after our loved ones are at the heart of our fight against this invisible enemy, which is why we’re doing everything we can to make sure the sector has all the support it needs to stop the spread and save lives. 

  Our support package introduces stronger measures on infection control and steps up clinical support to make sure there is a clinical lead assigned to every care home right across the country to offer advice and quicker support. This is an important set of measures to support care homes and their staff – to continue to do wonderful work caring for people, even at this most difficult of times.


Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  We have already provided councils with over £3.2 billion during this pandemic so that they can respond to the immediate pressures they are facing, including supporting social care.

  This new funding will be distributed to councils based on the number of care home beds in their area and will be passed on quickly to care providers. It will fund new measures to reduce the transmission of coronavirus in care homes, minimise infection, keep staff and residents safe and, ultimately, save lives.


Wellbeing support 

Samaritans, working with NHS England, have extended the use of their helpline to all social care workers. Social care staff will be able to speak to a trained Samaritans adviser who will provide a non-judgmental listening ear, safe space to offload and signposting to other services. 

Hospice UK will also extend their bereavement and trauma support hotline to people working in social care, with specialist counsellors available to support staff who have experienced trauma, stress or anxiety through their work. Mental health and wellbeing guidance for the adult social care workforce was recently published on the app to support staff and employers through the outbreak.

Testing

All symptomatic and asymptomatic care home staff and residents in England are already eligible for testing, and testing is prioritised for care homes that look after the over 65s. The new digital portal now enables care homes to register for the delivery and collection of test kits directly.

Workforce recruitment 

Today’s announcement also aims to further boost the social care workforce and work has begun to attract thousands more people into social care over the next 3 months through the new national social care recruitment campaign.

NHS support will see nurse returners being deployed to care homes through the Bringing Back Staff programme, as well providing infection control nurses to lead a ‘train the trainers’ approach for care homes available to every area in England. This includes advice about the recommended approach to infection prevention control, PPE usage and testing advice. This programme commenced at the beginning of May with the offer available to every area in England.

Ruth Sutherland, Samaritans CEO, said:


  We are so pleased that we can offer support to even more key workers who are doing such critical work on the frontline. Our volunteers are ready and waiting to provide a non-judgemental listening ear and a safe space to offload, at a time when we know so many are under huge emotional strain.

  All calls are completely confidential and answered by trained volunteers who will talk for as long as people want to, whilst also offering information about other sources of support that could be helpful.


Paul Johnstone, Deputy SRO for PHE COVID-19 Response at Public Health England (PHE), said: 


  We are delighted that the social care sector will get even more support in the form of the Social Care Fund, based on PHE research and emerging evidence from the World Health Organization. We are confident that these interventions will help to further reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and keep our care home residents and workers safe.  

  The excellent work carried out by Directors of Public Health and PHE’s Health Protection Teams has already made a huge difference to the local response to COVID-19. We will continue working with NHS England and DHSC to provide advice and support to the sector.


Tracey Bleakley, CEO, Hospice UK said: 


  We welcome the commitment the government is making to ensure that the care workforce is to benefit from bereavement and trauma support. These dedicated, frontline health professionals face very difficult situations dealing with COVID-19 which can take a toll on their mental health and wellbeing. This is why Hospice UK is so pleased to be able to extend our services to those in social care.


Background information

The scheme will cover frontline staff in England.
  As a result of this £600 million the devolved administrations will receive £113 million through the Barnett formula:
    the Scottish Government will receive £58 million
      the Welsh Government will receive £35 million
      the Northern Ireland Executive will receive £20 million
    
  The allocation shares for each council are calculated as [Number of care home beds * Area Cost Adjustment] / England sum of [Number of care home beds * Area Cost Adjustment]. The Area Cost Adjustment reflects differences in wages and prices in different councils.
  The funding will be paid in 2 equal instalments to local authorities. We have allocated funding to local authorities according to the number of care home beds in each area, with an adjustment to reflect the costs of operating in each area.
  We will request that 75% of the initial funding received is passed straight to care homes within the local authority’s geographical area for use on infection control measures, including to care homes with whom the local authority does not have existing contracts. The second payment will be contingent on the first being used for infection control. The remaining 25% must also be used for infection control measures, however local authorities are able to allocate based on need. This may involve support for domiciliary care workforce measures. To be eligible for support from the grant, providers who do not already must complete the daily care home Capacity Tracker.
  This approach ensures that the majority of funding reaches the front line as quickly as possible, while ensuring that local authorities have the flexibility to top up where it is most needed.
Further details of the Samaritans helpline are on its website.

28/02/2020,The UK has regained full competence to strike international agreements on Private International Law since leaving the EU.,"
    
          

now we have left the EU, the UK can capitalise on regaining full competence to enter into international agreements in Private International Law
  new Bill will allow those international agreements to be implemented in domestic law


Private International Law (PIL) agreements provide a legal framework to help resolve cross border legal disputes – from seeking to help the return of children abducted by a parent, deciding which court resolves an international business dispute, to helping to prevent a spouse living abroad dodging child maintenance obligations.

This Bill allows the UK to implement these agreements in domestic law, thereby helping individuals, businesses and families to resolve cross border disputes.

Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said:


  Now that we have left the EU, we can capitalise on the UK’s regained competence in this area of law.

  This Bill allows us to implement and operate current and future agreements on Private International Law, giving confidence to UK businesses, individuals and families looking to live, work, travel and trade across borders.


Without the ability to implement these agreements in domestic law, there could be parallel court cases in different countries, leading to conflicting decisions where UK individuals, businesses and families would bear the brunt of legal costs.

The Private International Law (Implementation of Agreements) Bill, was introduced in parliament yesterday (27 February 2020).

The Bill maintains our implementation of 3 key existing agreements, also known as Hague Conventions, while enabling the UK to implement other international agreements in PIL in domestic law in future via secondary legislation including the Lugano Convention 2007.

Notes to editors

Private International Law agreements cover aspects of civil, family and commercial law, with a real and lasting impacts on people’s lives. PIL agreements could mean, for example
    child maintenance obligations imposed in one country can be recognised and enforced in another
      UK citizens can have confidence that if they travel, buy goods or have an accident abroad there is a way to resolve any legal disputes that may arise.
      businesses can feel confident entering into cross-border transactions, knowing that in the event of a dispute, there is a clear framework of rules for resolving it
      divorces can be recognised in other countries
      children abducted by one of their parents can be returned to their home country, and
      businesses can feel confident entering into cross-border transactions, knowing that in the event of a dispute, there is a clear framework of rules for resolving it.
    
  Beyond underpinning future deals, the Bill simplifies the implementation of three existing Hague Conventions at the end of the Transition Period:
    1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children: Helps resolve issues around residence and contact with children where parents live in different countries
      2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements: Offers legal certainty in some cross-border contractual disputes by deciding which court should hear a case and enabling the decision to be recognised and enforced in another country
      2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance: Guarantees international recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance across borders
    
  
    A strategy for Private International Law will be set out in the coming months.
  
  The Bill was introduced in the House of Lords on Thursday.

21/01/2023,Thousands of troubled teens to benefit from cash boost to local sports groups.,"
    
          

Hundreds of organisations win cash to run projects for young people and cut crime
  Deputy Prime Minister and Sky Sports’ Jobi McAnuff see sporting success in action at ThruLife


Thousands of at-risk teens are set to pick up their racquets and lace up their football boots as part of a bid to keep them on the straight and narrow, the Deputy Prime Minister has announced today (21 January 2023).

More than 200 grassroots organisations across England and Wales have been awarded cash from the government’s £5 million Youth Justice Sports Fund to run local sports schemes – from climbing to kayaking – that will help keep vulnerable young people away from crime and antisocial behaviour.

The number of children caught up in crime is at a historical low – falling by 81 percent since 2010 but youth crime still costs the taxpayer £1.5 billion a year. Research shows 80 per cent of prolific adult offenders started on their path of crime when children, making the need to steer more young people away from lawbreaking all the more critical.

Announcing the news, the Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab visited ThruLife – one of the projects which have been awarded funding – at a local school in Tottenham, north London.

Joined by ThruLife founder Richard Allicock and Sky Sports pundit Jobi McAnuff, the Deputy Prime Minister swapped into his trainers as he joined penalty practice with youngsters at their after-school football club.

Deputy Prime Minister, Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor, Dominic Raab, said:


  I know first-hand how powerful sport and mentoring can be in turning young lives around.

  Sport has the power to boost confidence, build resilience and teach discipline, and evidence suggests sports can be effective in reducing offending among young people. That’s why we’re supporting over 200 organisations across England and Wales to encourage more young people to engage with sport and stay away from crime.


One of the surest ways to keep young people on the right path is to give them the skills to succeed in life – something sports schemes can provide, building young people’s resilience, self-confidence and discipline while engaging in a fun activity.

Emerging evidence suggests that sports-based intervention programmes – such as the Youth Sports Fund – can lead to improvements in offending. We know that early intervention done well reduces offending, for example, the

Supporting Families programme showed a 35 per cent reduction in youth prison sentences and a 15 per cent reduction in youth convictions.

Former Crystal Palace midfielder, Sky Sports commentator, and ThruLife ambassador Jobi McAnuff said:


  Organisations like ThruLife do amazing work. I know how important activities and places like this are, and to have positive role models, particularly in areas like this where I grew up.

  You can’t take shortcuts in life, whether that’s to be a professional footballer or whatever you want to achieve. There will be tough times in life, so if you have a passion for something like sport, it can help you to stay positive and committed.


Tom* who regularly attends ThruLife said:


  ThruLife has helped me to grow in confidence through the sports sessions I attend teaching me and others different skills that would better place us on our journey through life, and to help us make positive choices.


Richard Allicock, the founder of Thru Life, said:


  We are delighted to have been awarded this funding, which will help us to continue the positive work that we are doing in the community but also extend our offer to engage with more young people across the borough of Haringey utilising the powers of sport through our mentoring offer.


In November last year, the Deputy Prime Minister invited sports charities and organisations from across the country to bid for the £5 million fund, which saw hundreds of sports schemes apply.

Today, over 200 organisations across England and Wales have been awarded cash to run projects from climbing to boxing with vulnerable teens. Bidders were marked on whether they could show a track-record of helping young people at risk of falling into crime and antisocial behaviour to keep their noses clean.

The £5 million pot of money builds on the government’s existing support for local authorities’ Youth Offending Teams nationwide – which has seen over £730 million worth of funding provided in the last 5 years.

Minister for Sport, Civil Society & Youth Stuart Andrew said:


  We believe every young person should get the best start in life. Doing sport is a brilliant way of building focus and discipline while also improving physical health and stopping people becoming involved in crime.

  This funding will help make sure people are set on the right path from the outset.


The Sports Fund has been co-ordinated by StreetGames and the Alliance of Sport for Criminal Justice, with the support of the Sport for Development Coalition – an umbrella of more than 250 charities in the sports sector.

Stuart Felce, StreetGames Director of Sport and Community Safety, said:


  At StreetGames we believe that community sport, delivered in the right way, can have a transformational impact on children’s lives and the communities they live in. We’re really excited to be partnering with the Sport for Development Coalition and the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice to deliver this ambitious new programme from the Ministry of Justice. This investment in sport will support voluntary and community sports organisations to carry out targeted work to enhance positive outcomes for vulnerable children, providing the practical and emotional support they need to grow and helping to keep them and their communities safe.


Hitesh Patel, Executive Director of the Coalition, added:


  Reducing crime and anti-social behaviour is a core element of the Coalition’s #OpenGoal framework, which shows how the multiple returns on investment created by sport for development can help to generate significant public cost savings. We are delighted to be working alongside StreetGames and the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice to ensure this new funding supports and strengthens those organisations that can already demonstrate the positive social impact they are having on their local communities.


The funding also delivers on the commitment made in the Prisons Strategy White Paper – published in December 2022 – to cut youth crime and create safer streets.

Notes to editors

Tom’s name has been changed to protect his identity.
  
Over three-quarters of adult prolific offenders received their first caution or conviction as a juvenile.
  The Youth Justice Sports Fund is the first of its kind from the Ministry of Justice, driven by this government to urge young people across the country to engage with a range of sports workshops, schemes and classes to build essential life skills while staying away from crime.
  About the Sport for Development Coalition: The Coalition brings together more than 250 charities, networks and organisations using targeted sport and physical activity-based interventions to address key health and societal inequalities across the UK. This includes national networks such as StreetGames and the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice. Through its #OpenGoal framework, the Coalition aims to demonstrate the multiple returns on investment that targeted interventions can generate in disadvantaged communities, and potential public cost savings for policy-makers.

28/02/2023,The CMA has launched a market study into housebuilding and a separate project considering consumer rights for those in rented homes.,"
    
          With widespread concerns about housing availability and costs, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched a new phase of work in the housing sector. The CMA is launching a market study into housebuilding, and will start a separate consumer protection project related to rented accommodation.

The market study comes following concerns builders are not delivering the homes people need at sufficient scale or speed. The CMA’s consumer protection work will seek to shed light on the experience of renters and explore whether more could be done to help landlords and intermediaries to understand their obligations.

Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:


  The quality and cost of housing is one of the biggest issues facing the country. Over the last few years, the CMA delivered real change for leaseholders, with tens of thousands of homeowners receiving refunds after being overcharged unfair ground rents.

  With that work nearly finished, we’re now looking to probe in more detail two further areas – the housebuilding and the rental sectors.

  If there are competition issues holding back housebuilding in Britain then we need to find them. But we also need to be realistic that more competition alone won’t unlock a housebuilding boom.

  In the same vein, we want to explore the experiences people have of the rental sector and whether there are issues here that the CMA can help with.

  We will of course be guided by the evidence, but if we find competition or consumer protection concerns we are prepared to take the steps necessary to address them.


Housebuilding market study

The CMA’s market study into housebuilding will focus on 4 areas:

housing quality: looking at how builders are delivering the right sorts of homes that communities and buyers need – including the fairness of estate management fees charged for ‘unadopted’ roads and amenities
  land management: examining whether the practice of ‘banking’ land before or after receiving planning permission is anti-competitive
  local authority oversight: exploring how councils oversee the delivery of homes and how developers negotiate affordable home requirements
  innovation: considering whether factors may be holding builders back from adopting new building techniques or moving towards more sustainable, net zero homes
A market study allows the CMA to use compulsory information-gathering powers to probe the entire market. As well as helping develop a deeper understanding of how and when housebuilders decide to deliver new homes and the interaction of that with local authority housing targets, the study will consider the issues faced by smaller, regional firms.

03/02/2023,The CMA found that Portman Healthcare’s anticipated deal to buy Dentex Healthcare raised competition concerns which could harm treatment for patients living in the South West and North East,"
    
          An initial investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found that a merger between 2 dental providers would not harm the majority of patients in the United Kingdom, but action is needed to address specific competition concerns for those living in the South West and North East of England.

The CMA carried out a Phase 1 investigation into the anticipated purchase of Dentex Healthcare Group Limited (Dentex Healthcare) by Portman Healthcare (Group) Limited (Portman Healthcare), which is owned by Core Equity Holdings. The companies would together operate approximately 400 dental practices across the United Kingdom.

The investigation looked at the potential impact of the merger for patients in areas where both businesses currently offer NHS or private dental treatments, which range from general dentistry (for example, check-ups and fillings) to more complex procedures like implants and orthodontics.

While sufficient competition will remain after the merger in most cases, the CMA found that the deal would raise competition concerns in the provision of NHS orthodontic treatments in Truro as well as for private dental services provided to those living in Tavistock, Ashburton and Durham. Additional concerns were also found in relation to competition for NHS contracts to provide orthodontic services across Cornwall and Isles of Scilly, where access to specialist treatment is limited for patients.

Prior to the conclusion of the investigation, the businesses accepted that the merger would raise concerns in these areas and asked the CMA to move straight to a discussion of potential remedies to address these concerns.

Sorcha O’Carroll, CMA Senior Director of Mergers, said:


  Everyone should have access to dental treatment wherever they live in the UK. Competition between dental practices is crucial to ensure patients have access to good quality services at competitive prices. While in the majority of areas the deal will not harm patients, we are concerned that it could lead to less choice, lower quality and higher prices for patients in certain parts of the UK.

  The businesses involved have accepted our concerns and it’s now up to them to address these effectively, so we can prevent a loss of competition in the South West and North East – resolving any need for further investigation.

Notes to editors


    More information on the CMA’s fast track procedure can be found in section 7 of Mergers: Guidance on the CMA’s jurisdiction and procedure (PDF, 1.04MB).
  
  
    The CMA is, in most cases, required to issue a Phase 1 decision within 40 working days. Merging parties are required to formally offer proposed remedies (undertakings in lieu of a referral to a Phase 2 investigation (UILs)) within 5 working days after receiving the CMA’s Phase 1 decision and the CMA then decides, within 10 working days after the Phase 1 decision, whether to provisionally accept the UILs offered. The CMA then has 50 working days (subject to an extension of up to 40 working days) to consider whether to finally accept these remedies.
  
  
    The CMA’s concerns within Cornwall and Isles of Scilly, including specifically in Truro, relate to the provision of NHS orthodontic treatments by the parties. The cost of treatments through these appointments is strictly regulated by the NHS – so patients will pay the same if they are able to get treatment.  The CMA’s concerns in Tavistock relate to the private provision of orthodontic and implant treatments; in Durham, the private provision of general dentistry, restorative, periodontics and cosmetics treatments; and in Ashburton, the private provision of implant treatments.

02/02/2023,All recommendations made by the CMA to tackle issues in the children’s social care market in England have been accepted by the Department for Education.,"
    
          

All CMA recommendations to tackle “dysfunctional” children’s social care market accepted
  Department for Education commits to ongoing programme of implementation
  CMA CEO says: “This is a much-needed first step to improving the lives of vulnerable children and young people who rely on these services”
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a market study into children’s social care in March 2021 due to concerns over a lack of availability of placements and high prices.


The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a market study into children’s social care in March 2021 due to concerns over a lack of availability of placements and high prices.

Its final report, published in March 2022, found there is a shortage of appropriate places in children’s homes and with foster carers – meaning some children are not getting the right care from their placement. It also found that some children are being placed far away from their hometown or separated from their siblings. This shortage of places has driven up prices, meaning local authorities – who are responsible for placing children in an appropriate home – are paying higher costs, which are then picked up by taxpayers.

The CMA’s study also found that private sector investors appear to be making higher profits in England and Wales than the CMA would expect in a well-functioning and competitive market. This suggests authorities may be paying more for these services than they need to, particularly when it comes to fostering services which are often cheaper when run by local authorities.

To address the issues it found and help make sure children are properly protected, the CMA made a number of recommendations to government – all of which have today been accepted by the Department for Education (DfE) in respect of England.

As part of its wider strategy to improve the sector, the DfE has committed to implement these recommendations to ensure long-term reform, including:

Developing regional bodies to support local authorities in obtaining suitable placements for children: These bodies will be able to engage better with placement providers, such as care homes and foster agencies, to help make sure the right placements are available when and where children need them. They will also be trialled and evaluated to make sure they are fit for purpose.
  Introducing a financial oversight regime: Establish an oversight regime to assess the financial health of care home providers that are most difficult to replace, and alert authorities if a failure is likely.
  Reviewing regulation relating to the placement of children: Create an expert working group to review all existing legislation and regulation regarding children’s social care, and develop a common set of standards for fostering, children’s homes and supported accommodation.
Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive at the CMA, said:


  This is a much-needed first step to improving the lives of vulnerable children and young people who rely on these services. Our recommendations, all of which have been accepted by the Department for Education, will help build a better and more supportive system.

  We’ll continue to work with the government to make sure these proposals deliver longstanding improvements, providing every child in care with the right home.


The CMA’s study looked at children’s social care in England, Scotland, and Wales, across which there are over 100,000 looked-after children. The current annual cost for children’s social care services is around £5.7 billion in England, £680 million in Scotland and £350 million in Wales.

The study highlighted and reflected the significant differences in the policy context for children’s social care between England, Scotland, and Wales. The Scottish Government and the Welsh Government each committed to move away from the model of for-profit provision in children’s social care, and national organisations exist in these nations to support local authorities. The CMA will continue to work with both governments as they move through their own policy reform processes.

For more information, see the Children’s social care study webpage.

Notes to editors

Analysis of prices and profits is from financial data obtained from the 15 largest private providers of children’s social care across all three nations, covering the period since the financial year 2016. Our analysis covers independent providers responsible for around a fifth of placements in children’s homes and slightly over half of fostering placements.
  In England, 72% of children in care are placed in foster care, 13% in residential care such as children’s homes, and 15% in other settings including unregulated accommodation. In Scotland, 33% are in foster care, 10% in residential care and 57% in other settings (the higher percentage in other settings in Scotland reflects a broader definition of care, but excludes unregulated settings, which is not permitted in Scotland). In Wales, 70% of children are in foster care, 7% in residential care, and 23% in other settings.
  The largest proportion of children’s homes places in England and Wales are provided by the for-profit sector – around 78% in England and 77% in Wales. This compares to 35% in Scotland. Most fostering placements are provided by local authority foster carers – 64% in England, 69% in Scotland and 73% in Wales. However, a significant minority are provided by private providers (except in Scotland where for-profit provision is not permitted) and voluntary providers.

15/03/2023,Statement by Ambassador Barbara Woodward at the UN Security Council briefing on Yemen,"
    
          
Thank you, President.

I’d like to start by joining others in offering condolences to Mozambique and to Malawi for the damages that Cyclone Freddy has caused in your countries.

Hans, Joyce, thank you for your briefings.

As Ramadan approaches, so too does the one-year anniversary of the UN-brokered truce. The UK welcomes continued efforts toward a negotiated political settlement, and reiterates the need for dialogue to bring together all Yemeni parties.

We urge the Houthis to engage directly with the internationally recognised Government of Yemen, and the UN. An inclusive political settlement is the only way to bring stability to Yemen.

While we work towards long-term stability, we must also act, as others have said, to mitigate the suffering of Yemenis right now. Nearly 22 million Yemenis are in urgent need of assistance. The UK welcomes the vital role of UNVIM in facilitating commercial cargo flows into Yemen to alleviate this suffering.

Mahram requirements in the north are excluding women from delivering and accessing assistance. As well as being an egregious injustice, this drives up the cost of living. We strongly urge the Houthi authorities to reconsider this policy.

Efforts to address economic instability are also fundamental to reducing humanitarian need and the UK welcomes the generous financial contributions of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to address the serious economic situation of the Yemeni people.

Houthi terrorist attacks and threats have blocked Government of Yemen oil exports, again increasing the cost of living for Yemenis. We call on the Houthis to refrain from all escalatory action.

Arms smuggling is destabilising Yemen and the region. The British Navy, and our US and French partners, continue to interdict Iranian arms shipments. We call upon all involved to stop driving regional instability.

Finally, we welcome the major progress made on the FSO Safer salvage operation. The UN’s procurement of a replacement vessel is a vital step toward mitigating the threat of a spill.

But, the mission does not stop here.

We ask the UN to share its detailed budget and for the international community to step up and fill the $34m funding gap. Without these, the operation cannot start.

Thank you.

07/09/2021,"Following unprecedented fluctuations to earnings caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has today announced legislation to set aside for one year the use of average earnings growth figures for State Pensions up-rating.","
    
          In taking this decision, the government has carefully considered the fairest approach for both pensioners and younger taxpayers.

This legislation will ensure pensioner incomes still receive a significant boost, uprating by the higher of inflation or 2.5%.

The growth in earnings is estimated to be between 8% and 8.5%. This would mean a difference of around £4 or 5 billion in basic and new State Pensions expenditure in 2022/23, when comparing with the higher of 2.5% or expected price inflation.

Younger people have been hit hardest by the financial impacts of the pandemic, and the artificial inflation of pensioner incomes at this time would be out of kilter with the pressures being experienced by the rest of the population.

This makes sure pensioners’ spending power is preserved and they’re protected from higher costs of living.

But will also ensure that as we are having to make difficult decisions elsewhere across public spending – including freezing public sector pay – pensioners are not unfairly benefitting from a statistical anomaly.

This new legislation is a one-year response to exceptional circumstances and the government plans to return the earnings element of the Triple Lock next year.

Since 2010, the full yearly basic State Pension has increased by over £2,050 in cash terms.

01/12/2021,"Today, tens of thousands of low income households will get a cash boost as higher Universal Credit payments land in bank accounts for the first time.","
    
          As announced in the Autumn Budget, the taper rate – the amount that a person’s Universal Credit is reduced by as they earn more – has dropped from 63% to 55%. Simultaneously, work allowances, the amount eligible claimants can earn before their Universal Credit is reduced, have increased by £500 per year.

The changes mean people will keep more of what they earn, representing an effective tax cut worth £2.2 billion for the lowest earners.

Taken together the move will see, in total, almost two million of the lowest paid working families better off each year by an average of £1,000.

The Department for Work and Pensions has introduced the changes as quickly as possible, passing regulations last week to secure the higher payments for the lowest earners in time for Christmas.

Prime Minister, Boris Johnson said:


  It’s right that we support hard-working families, and this change will help some of the country’s lowest income families keep more of their money.

  Together with the increase in the minimum wage and our investments in skills and training, it shows this is a government committed to making work pay.



Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey said:


  Tens of thousands of the lowest earners will see a boost to their bank accounts today following changes to Universal Credit, meaning that people can keep more of what they earn to help with the cost of living.

  We introduced this change earlier than planned which will see up to 500,000 more households benefitting before Christmas.


Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer said:


  We want this to be a country that rewards work, where hard-working families get to keep more of their hard-earned cash.

  That’s why at Budget I announced changes to the Universal Credit taper rate that will see two million of the lowest paid families benefit from an effective £2bn tax cut.

  These people will get an average of £1,000 more a year – and this extra money will start appearing in their bank accounts today, just in time for Christmas.


The changes mean, for example, that a single mother of two, renting in Darlington, working a full-time job on the National Living Wage, will see her take-home income increase by £1,200 on an annual basis.

Meanwhile, a couple with two children, renting their home, where one partner works full time at the National Living Wage and the other works 16 hours a week earning the same, will be £1,800 per year better off.

Vulnerable households across the country are also able to access the £500 million Household Support Fund to help them with essentials over the coming months as the country continues its recovery from the pandemic. The devolved administrations will receive almost £80 million of the £500 million (£41 million for the Scottish Government, £25 million for the Welsh Government and £14 million for the NI Executive).

08/06/2011,How UK aid is helping to lower the price of HIV treatment,"
    
          
A test of courage

Josephy and Otilia Magadi and their twins Mphatso and Chisomo, age 4, live in the Machinga District of Malawi. Two years ago, Chisomo’s health began to rapidly decline - despite her parents’ efforts, she was just not getting better. Otilia brought her to the nearest health centre, where she was diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition. Chisomo’s case was so bad that the clinic referred her to the hospital for immediate treatment and suggested she take an HIV test.

Otilia recalls that she was nervous to have Chisomo tested. HIV still carries a stigma, but Otilia’s main concern was access - she knew of cases in the past where children had trouble getting the antiretoviral drugs they needed if they tested positive. Her fear brought to light the issue of how testing with no treatment can make someone feel helpless and that testing itself is pointless. However Otilia learned from the hospital staff that the drugs would be readily available and easy for her daughter to take. The staff also explained importance of starting an HIV positive child on treatment. Otilia agreed and Chisomo was tested. She was found HIV positive and was immediately put on treatment. Hospital staff also recommended that her twin brother Mphatso immediately be tested for HIV, along with both parents.

The road to recovery

Josephy, Otilia, and Mphasto all tested positive for HIV. Their decision to get tested was driven both because they saw how sick Chisomo was, and because doctors and nurses helped them to understand the importance of being on treatment. Josephy was pleased to witness the significant improvement in Chisomo’s health once she started on treatment; he reported that her improved health really demonstrated to him the power of antiretroviral drugs.

As of May 2011, Josephy, Otilia, Chisomo, and Mphasto are all healthy. The twins have been on treatment for nearly 2 years and are thriving. The family’s long-term prognosis is a good one, and thanks to the efforts of the UK funded Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and others, it is improving each day.  

A life more ordinary

Otilia recently explained how easy it was for her to access and keep her entire family on treatment. She reported that the drugs are always readily available. She is happy that she and her family were tested: she now has happy, healthy children; she knows if she had not gotten them tested they would likely not be alive today.

Otilia explains that the health centre staff and her family’s expert clinician told her that if her CD4 count remains good, she stays on treatment, and enrolls in the prevention of mother to child transmission program, she and Josephy could have another child that would be HIV negative.

The prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) pilot programme, which CHAI piloted in partnership with Malawi’s Ministry of Health, offers Otilia and her family the entire continuum of care under one roof: ARV drug treatment, an ante-natal clinic and diagnostics, community outreach, psychosocial support, post-natal and follow up for mother and child. Since CHAI began this work in Machinga in 2009, there has been a 50% decrease in mother-to-child transmission at 6 weeks following birth and a 35% decrease in at the 18 month mark.

Not only will Chisomo and Mphasto grow up healthy, happy, and on treatment, but Josephy and Otilia, and their future children, will also be able to live long and productive lives.

How we are helping

DFID is a major supporter of CHAI and its access to medicines programme. CHAI works closely with suppliers of key antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to identify opportunities to achieve price reductions, leading to significant cost savings for developing country governments.

The cost savings were made possible by building demand for new products, which stimulates market competition and leads to volume-based discounts, while collaborating with suppliers to achieve cost reductions through more efficient manufacturing processes and sourcing of raw materials.

Today, thanks in large measure to UK-funded efforts, 3.9 million people benefit from life-saving ARV drugs purchased at reduced prices, representing well over two-thirds of all people living with HIV and on treatment in developing countries.

Recent global progress

In May 2011, DFID and CHAI, together with UNITAID, announced further price reductions on key ARV drugs. Since 2008, this partnership has achieved price reductions that will generate global savings of at least $600 million over the next three years, making HIV treatment more widely accessible and saving countless lives.

In addition, these recent price reductions will make preferred, first-line ARV drugs like tenofovir (TDF) and efavirenz (EFV) more readily available. Until recently, regimens based on these drugs have been prohibitively expensive for wide use in developing countries. In 2008, low-income countries paid an average annual cost of $400 per patient per year for a once-daily combination regimen including TDF and EFV. This regimen is now available at an annual per patient cost of less than $159, a reduction of 60%.

Treatment options for the Magadi family and others will soon be further improved, when the government of Malawi takes advantage of the increased accessibility of TDF and EFV by introducing a new national drug regimen. The government aims to ensure that this new regimen will be accessible to Malawi’s entire population of people on treatment for HIV and AIDS, and offer a lower daily pill burden for patients, making adherence to treatment far more likely.

Just the beginning

We will continue to work with the Clinton Health Access Initiative to generate cost savings to buy medicines for 500,000 more people by 2015. This commitment forms just one part of our recently published strategy on tackling HIV in the developing world - Towards zero infections.

20/10/2020,Criminals in Wales who commit alcohol-fuelled crimes can be banned from drinking and ordered to wear a ‘sobriety tag’ by judges from today (Wednesday 21 October) and will be extended to England early next year.,"
    
          

Tags in force from today in Wales, extended to England next year
  Tags will monitor compliance with alcohol bans handed down by courts as part of community sentences
  New technology will help tackle root cause of criminal behaviour to reduce reoffending


The tags monitor offenders’ sweat every 30 minutes and alert the probation service if alcohol is consumed. Not complying with their alcohol abstinence order – new powers allowing courts to issue drinking bans for up to 120 days – could see them back in court for further sentencing or facing fines.

It is the latest boost to the Government’s plans to make community sentences more robust, a tougher punishment while also making criminals less likely to reoffend. Last month, the Lord Chancellor set out reforms to make community orders stricter and expand the use of electronic monitoring.

Alcohol is a factor in around 39% of violent crime, with the social and economic cost of alcohol-related harm stretching to over £21 billion per year. It is seen as one of the driving influencers of domestic violence and unprovoked attacks on strangers. That is why the sobriety tags will be backed up by targeted professional support, signposting offenders to the help they need to improve their lifestyle and rein in their drinking. Referrals to treatment will continue to be made for those with more serious alcohol addictions who commit crimes.

Minister for Crime and Policing, Kit Malthouse MP said:


  All too often we see the devastating effects of alcohol-fuelled behaviour, reckless crimes and casual violence which blight our neighbourhoods and the lives of too many victims.



  This proven new tool can break the self-destructive cycle that offenders end up in, helping them sober up if they choose to and the courts to punish those who don’t.


The scheme follows two successful pilots in London and across Humberside, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire which showed that offenders were alcohol free on over 97% of the days monitored. Wearers also reported a positive impact on their lives, wellbeing and behaviour.

At present, abstinence orders can last for four months but we are looking at whether they should be able to last longer as part of our sentencing reforms.

The tags alert staff when they have been tampered with and can distinguish between drinks and other types of alcohol – such as hand sanitiser or perfume. They work 24/7 and can also tell if someone tries to block contact between the tag and their skin.

Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart said:


  Alcohol can have a devastating impact on lives and figures show it is a key factor behind far too many crimes.



  I am encouraged to see Wales at the forefront of implementing this new technology, which we believe will contribute towards lowering reoffending rates, making our streets safer and supporting those who need help.


The Government’s plans to overhaul sentencing will see dangerous offenders spend longer in prison, while greater efforts are made to tackle the root causes of offending. More support will be on offer for those willing to turn their back on crime through treatment for mental health issues and addictions. Supervision of offenders in the community will be improved with greater powers for probation officers and increased curfews. The Government also plans to use GPS tags to track burglars, robbers and thieves when they are released from prison.

10/09/2019,"Wages for UK workers have continued to grow, as new figures released today show wages  have been rising faster than inflation for a year and a half, growing by 1.9% in real terms on last year.","
    
          The number of people in work is up 369,000 on last year. This means more workers across the UK are benefiting from greater financial security and increased spending power than a year ago.

The government continues to support families with the cost of living, ensuring they can keep more of what they earn. This includes raising the personal tax allowance and increasing the National Living Wage – which has boosted earnings for 2.4 million workers since 1 April. 

Job opportunities for UK workers also continue to grow as we have seen 292,000 more people employed in the private sector in the last year.

The UK labour market has seen over 1.8 million more women in employment since 2010, a testament to the government’s dedication to tackling potential barriers to work for women in search of a new career – including those who need to work flexibly to fit around family life.

Minister for Employment, Mims Davies said:

“Wages are consistently rising faster than inflation – now for over a year and a half – meaning we’re seeing a sustained boost in pay, supporting consumer confidence and giving a vital lift to millions of households who gain from greater financial security.

“This joint record employment rate and decades-low unemployment shows our labour market is booming. It’s especially pleasing to see continued record female employment at 72.1%, signalling the great strides we’ve made in empowering women in the workplace, whatever their background.

“There is still more to do. But today’s positive figures again show a thriving, diverse and resilient labour market to be proud of, and we are in great shape for Brexit on 31 October.”

Today’s figures from the Office for National Statistics also show that the number of people in employment has risen on the year with the South East and the East Midlands seeing the biggest rise in employment at 148,000 and 74,000 respectively; evidence that workers up and down the country are able to pursue employment, regardless of background.

Since 2010, we have seen 2.8 million more people employed in higher skilled roles, which generally command a higher wage. The UK labour market remains in a strong position as the UK prepares to leave the EU.

22/01/2021,A ground-breaking Local Partnership Agreement has been signed by the Department for Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Prison & Probation Service (HMPPS).,"
    
          The agreement aims to get the best possible outcome for offenders on leaving custody.

The agreement, the first of its kind, is a contract between the department and prisons, setting out a steadfast commitment to working together and outlining shared objectives.

It is hoped this joined-up approach will effectively support offenders in preparation for release, and ultimately reduce reoffending which costs the taxpayer £18 billion each year.

Local Partnership Agreements form part of National Partnership Agreements, which aim to support businesses by increasing opportunities and moving unemployed people into sustainable jobs.

Minister for Welfare Delivery, Will Quince, said:


  We are proud to be joining forces with HMPPS through this unique partnership and together we remain committed to ensuring prison leavers stay out of jail for good.



  Our dedicated teams of Prison Work Coaches are passionate about finding work for prison leavers. Preparing them for employment and life back in the community before release we know can make a life-changing difference and help free them from crime.


Minister for Prisons, Lucy Frazer, added:


  Helping prisoners find work is a crucial part of turning their lives around and cutting crime.



  This new partnership will mean prisoners are able to prepare for employment while they’re getting ready for release – benefitting them, the economy and society as a whole.


Under the agreement, each partner sets out their defined roles and statutory responsibilities, but each must work together to ensure the most effective join-up between services to provide support to those in custody, and on leaving.

Each local agreement is tailored to the individual prison. Quarterly meetings will be held between both partners and the agreement regularly reviewed.

This collaborative approach between the DWP and HMPPS to support prisoners brings together many services from providing work experience and education in prison and beyond, through to support, training and employment opportunities for ex-offenders.

And now, thanks to the national rollout of a phone line, prison leavers will also be supported to claim Universal Credit online, and can apply for an advance meaning they can access money on the day of release.

East Anglia District Manager Julia Nix said:


  Everybody deserves a second chance. Many prison leavers want to make a change on release and return to a life of work, and that has to be beneficial for the economy.



  Together with support from HMPPS we encourage, support and prepare prisoners for employment because we know that a job can help turn their lives around, lift them from poverty, and that motivates us every day.

18/01/2021,Secure video calls rolled out in all prisons in just over 6 months to maintain vital family contact.,"
    
          

over 90,000 calls made so far, connecting families in the UK and overseas
  technology helped teenager communicate again with his deaf mother and allowed a prisoner to meet his baby for the first time


Secure video calls are now running in all public and private prisons and young offender institutions (YOIs) across England and Wales, helping to maintain vital family ties and boost rehabilitation during the Coronavirus pandemic.

Offenders with strong family ties are less likely to reoffend, which costs the taxpayer around £18 billion per year, while 97% of prisoners say that video calls have a positive impact on their mental health.

With the final installation of video call technology taking place last month, in just over 6 months, over 90,000 video calls have been made totalling almost 45,000 hours and connecting families in more than 100 countries, while social visits were suspended to help reduce the spread of the virus, save lives and protect the NHS.

The secure video calls are allowing prisoners to see their toddlers take their first steps, say goodbye to a terminally-ill loved one and helping those struggling with their mental health.

Prisons Minister Lucy Frazer QC MP said:


  Video calls have been a huge success in our response to COVID-19 in the prison estate, with staff and offenders overwhelmingly positive about the impact of the technology.

  Prisoners have seen drastic changes to their daily routines to save lives and to protect local health services. Part of that has been the loss of social visits – something we know plays a huge role in prisoners’ wellbeing and rehabilitation and these calls are allowing them to keep this vital family contact.


The video calls take place on secure laptops in a designated area in each prison. Safeguards are in place to prevent misuse with all participants checked in advance, calls are monitored by prison staff and restrictions have been built into the software to ensure safe use.

Graham Barrett, Governor at HMP Wandsworth said:


  Video calls have been an incredibly positive step forward in what has been a very difficult time. It has revolutionised the way that people can communicate with loved ones and having such a user- friendly service has ensured that the men in our care can keep in touch with family and friends all over the world.


A Prisoner at HMP Thorn Cross said:


  It has been a complete game-changer for me. I can’t imagine not seeing my children for the past nine months, so the peace of mind of knowing that they are ok, and for them to see me and know that I am ok has really helped all of us.

  My family do not live locally, so I would like to continue to use video calling to speak to them, even after visits and ROTL are running again.


The new technology builds on the 2017 Lord Farmer review which found that close bonds between prisoners and family members can significantly reduce their risk of reoffending.

Plans are being implemented for the long-term. In the meantime, video calls remain in place for prisoners and their loved-ones while social visits are restricted.

Notes to editors

Video calls are a complementary resource to help maintain family contact not a replacement for social visits and where face-to-face visits can safely be delivered and remain the preference, no prisoner will be asked to substitute that for a video call.
  Time-limited calls are made either by prisoners making a call request to their designated contact or by families who can request a time slot through a mobile app or directly with the establishment.
  In March the government introduced temporary restrictions in prisons to prevent the virus taking hold – a decision that has saved the lives of staff, prisoners and children in custody, and protected the NHS.
  These measures, backed by Public Health England, included:
    Creating distinct areas where vulnerable prisoners can shield, the symptomatic can isolate, and new arrivals can quarantine
      Creating an additional 1,200 temporary cells so people are better able to social distance and we can limit the spread of infection
      Making important adjustments to prison life – including placing prisoners in social ‘bubbles’ so they could safely spend more time out of their cells for vital education, work, and exercise
    
  We are further bolstering our defences to reduce the risk of transmission by:
    Temporarily stopping social visits for adult prisoners in line with the new national restrictions. However, visits for compassionate reasons, visits to children in custody and official or legal visits will continue.
      Introducing routine testing of frontline staff and prisoners who arrive from court or transfer from other jails to catch infections earlier.
      Making more Personal Protective Equipment available to staff who come into close contact with offenders, so they can protect themselves and the offenders in their care.

Funds to help ensure 15,000 people continue to have a safe place to stay and are helped into long term accommodation
  Jenrick praises ‘remarkable national effort’ to protect vulnerable during pandemic


The next step in the government’s plans to help ensure some of the most vulnerable people in society continue to have a roof over their heads and are helped into long term accommodation was launched today by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick.

From today (18 July 2020), councils and their local partners can apply for funds from the government’s Next Steps Accommodation Programme to cover property costs and support new tenancies for around 15,000 vulnerable people who were provided with emergency accommodation during the pandemic.

This programme now takes total government support for homelessness and rough sleepers to over half a billion pounds. This will help ensure as few people as possible helped off the streets and into accommodation during the pandemic return to sleeping rough and help to break the cycle of homelessness for good.

A total of £105 million is now available to ensure interim accommodation and support continues for those who need it and can be used to help people move into the private rented sector, extend or secure alternative interim accommodation or where possible help people to reconnect with friends or family.

In addition, first wave funding, totalling £161 million, is also available to provide 3,300 additional supported homes this year for those currently housed in emergency accommodation. This is part of a total of £433 million to provide 6,000 long term, safe homes for those in need.

This funding is part of the response coordinated by Dame Louise Casey, who has been leading the COVID-19 Rough Sleeping Taskforce. Expert advisers will also be available to support local partners develop their plans for accommodation and related support services.

Last week official statistics showed that the combined efforts of central and local government, the NHS, charities and other partners to get people off the street and into safe accommodation has helped protect the most vulnerable in society and save lives.  

Secretary of State for Housing Robert Jenrick MP said:


  The remarkable national effort to support rough sleepers and vulnerable people during this crisis has protected many lives and I am hugely grateful to all those involved. 



  We now have a landmark opportunity to break the cycle of rough sleeping and ensure that people do not return to a life on the streets.



  Today I am launching the funding to ensure that vulnerable people and rough sleepers continue to have a roof over their heads and are helped into longer term accommodation, enabling them to start to rebuild their lives.


Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Luke Hall MP said:


  There has been a colossal effort from our councils, charities and partners to provide a protective shield for the most vulnerable during this pandemic.



  Their efforts must not be in vain and today’s release of funding will make a huge difference by preventing thousands from returning to the streets with further support to allow them to rebuild their lives with a roof above their heads.

25/11/2010,This project aimed to improve the well-being of the poor in informal urban settlements through cost-effective local water supply services.,"
    
          
The pace of urbanisation is exceeding the ability of many water utilities to provide services for new customers, or even to maintain standards for existing customers. In many cities of Africa, Asia and South America, more than half the population of towns and cities pay high prices to obtain their water services from suppliers other than the official water supply utility.

The project, Better access to water in informal urban settlements through support to Water-Providing Enterprises (SWEs) was lead by the Water, Engineering and Development Centre in association with the International institute for Environment and Development and Practical Action. It aimed to contribute to improving the livelihood of the poor in informal urban settlements through cost effective improved water supply services. The countries involved were Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya and Sudan.

Private enterprises, usually operated by small scale entrepreneurs, earn money from the sale of water, and are defined as Small Water Enterprises (SWEs). During Phase 1 of the project, local teams worked to identify constraints, opportunities and strategies for enabling SWEs to deliver acceptable water services to low income urban consumers. Kiosk operation is a form of SWE that has good potential for expansion, with the potential to provide improved services in terms of reduced cost, a more reliable water supply, and increased assurance of water quality.

A selection of the improvements identified in the two cities of Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were then tested during Phase 2 of the research project. Kiosks are most suitable close to existing distribution pipelines, where installation costs are low. The costs of laying and maintaining a connecting pipe to a kiosk increase with the distance from the nearest existing pipeline, and this may affect kiosks affordability. Where kiosks are considered an appropriate way of improving water services from SWEs, various physical, institutional and other components are necessary for the kiosks to operate successfully.

Findings showed that services provided by SWEs can be improved if there are changes in attitude by SWEs, utilities and governments, involving recognition of SWE activities by both utilities and governments. Improvement is likely to be gradual, as trusting relationships are developed between utility staff and SWEs.

The research shows that services provided by SWEs can be improved through guidance, and dialogue with utilities. Improvements in services delivered by SWEs are still likely to fall short of providing safe clean water for every home. However, improvements in SWE operating practices can not only make a critical difference, but can represent progress towards this long term goal.

SWEs, government, municipalities, utilities on a local level were targeted with in-country workshops. Conferences and regional workshops were held and publications were employed to reach regional agencies, utilities, researchers, policy advisers. On a national and international level, a web site and journal papers were used. The project included action research, encouraging dialogue between stakeholders, and encouraging them to identify acceptable working relationships. It investigated what market incentives exist for better water services, and how these can be realised. For many years SWEs has had an undeserved reputation of exploiting the poor, and selling unsafe water at high prices to vulnerable poor communities.

Those currently benefiting are the people living in some informal low income areas of Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. They have greater confidence in the quality of the water, better access to it, and at a lower cost than previously. Utilities can reduce the quantity of water lost through leaks and illegal connections, meet new demands, and collect payments for water sold from kiosks. Kiosk operators can earn a living, and other local SWEs can have better access to water of good quality. Communities may have benefited indirectly, with more money being retained in the local economy, through local trade and employment. The findings potentially have widespread significance, because the majority of the people living in many cities of Africa, Asia and South America obtain their water services from unofficial suppliers.

05/01/2020,Up to £165 million new funding to help families get their lives back on track announced.,"
    
          Families with deep rooted problems will receive much-needed support to get their lives back on track with up to £165 million of new funding, Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP announced today (5 January 2020).

The funding for the Troubled Families programme will provide intensive support for some of the most vulnerable families.

Working with the whole family unit across local services, with a focus on early intervention, the programme has a proven track record of driving reforms across public services.

The funding will be used to tackle complex inter-connected problems including unemployment, poor school attendance, mental health issues, anti-social behaviour and domestic abuse. 

Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  The Troubled Families programme will help more people in need get access to the early, practical and coordinated support to transform their lives for the better.

  This is the right thing to do for families and for society as a whole, and these reforms will reduce the demand and dependency on costly, reactive key public services.

  We want to build on the success of the programme in the coming year, delivering on our manifesto commitment to ensure we reach all those who could benefit from the programme – from the early years and throughout their lives.


Rather than responding to each problem, or single family member separately, assigned Troubled Families keyworkers engage with the whole family. Through this approach they coordinate support from a range of services to identify and address family issues as early as possible rather than merely reacting to crises.

The latest evaluation results show that, compared to families with similar characteristics who have not been on the programme, 19-24 months after starting to receive support:  


    the proportion of children on the programme going into care has reduced by a third
  
  
    the proportion of adults on the programme going to prison has reduced by a quarter and juvenile convictions reduced by 15%
  
  
    more people on the programme are back in work, with 10% fewer people claiming Jobseekers Allowance.
  
The programme was originally set to run for 5 years from 2015 to 2020 but was extended by a year in Spending Round 2019. Today £165 million of funding has been confirmed for 2020 to 2021. 

Since the current programme began in 2015, 297,733 families have made improvements with the problems that led to them joining the programme. In 26,848 of these families one or more adults has moved off benefits and into work. 

Futher information 

The current Troubled Families Programme was rolled out in England in April 2015 and replaced the first programme which had been in place since 2012. 

The third annual report of the current Troubled Families Programme annual report Building Resilient Families is available.

01/12/2016,This project uses secure online video conferencing to enable HIV prevention support for marginalised communities in rural Hampshire.,"
    
          
What is involved

The rural nature of Hampshire means that for many, access to services can be challenging. The associated costs and time needed to engage with special support for HIV prevention and HIV treatment and care can be prohibitively difficult so while successful 1:1 support programmes and treatment and care support is available, many do not take up these offers.

The target groups for this service are rurally isolated men who have sex with men (MSM), young MSM, Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) and Black African (BAC) communities and socially and rurally isolated people living with HIV who will access support via mobile telephones, PCs and tablets.

Positive Action will work in partnership with Solent NHS Trust Sexual Health Service, counselling services and peer support programmes to provide secure interventions including:

condom access
  the negotiation of safer sex activity (including chemsex)
  clinical interventions to enable increased adherence to medication
  welfare and preventative social care
The partnership with local NHS Sexual Health Services will enable online access to HIV specialists, Central nervous system specialists (CNS), pharmacists, consultants and HIV prevention specialists. This will be delivered through a single, secure portal that includes:

text and telephone support
  access to condoms by post
  self-sampling for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV
  an HIV portal for results and medication management
  remote access support via internet chat rooms and social media
There will be access to translation services for membership of BME and BAC communities that may find access to health care and HIV prevention complex due to language barriers.

Anticipated benefits

The service will benefit the local area by providing, in an innovative way, increased access to HIV prevention, treatment and care, welfare advice and peer support. 
The remote delivery of preventative social care to people living with HIV will enable individuals to access other specialist support from a range of professionals including counsellors. This will support better adherence to treatment and increased decision making in sexual relationships.

It will also enable access to support workers who can support around issues of debt, housing, employment, all of which impact upon a person’s wellbeing.

Next steps

The project will be monitored and evaluated using the following metrics:

access and use of the web-chat service
  qualitative feedback from both the professionals and the service users on the effectiveness of online engagement, and in resulting behaviour change
  quantitative data on the number, type and length of online sessions, and to which specialist support services
  access to STI and HIV testing in sexual health services or through self-sampling methods
  cost effectiveness of sessions based on cost via web-chat vs cost via face to face interventions
Donna Bone, Chief Executive, Positive Action said:

“In direct response to the increasing number of people living with HIV in employment and education, Positive Action and Solent NHS Trust will be creating new ways of accessing information, advice and support.

“By developing web-chat and video-chat appointments which can be accessed by PCs, tablets and smart phones, we anticipate that access to some medical and support appointments will be much easier to achieve.

“People living with HIV in Hampshire will be able to receive information about medication, test results, safer sex and relationships support without needing to attend clinical appointments.”

27/02/2020,"The number of nurses has gone up as the government works to increase nursing numbers in the NHS by 50,000 in the next 5 years.","
    
          Since 2010, there have been increases of more than:

20,000 more doctors
  18,500 more nurses, midwives and health visitors
  4,900 more paramedics
The government has said there will be 50,000 more nurses and 6,000 more doctors in general practice by 2025.

This will be supported by £33.9 billion of funding a year for the NHS by 2024 to 2025, which is being made law.

Student nurses, midwives and many allied health professionals such as paramedics on courses from September, will get support of at least £5,000 a year to help with their living costs. They will not need to pay this back.

The latest UCAS statistics show the number of nursing applicants to English universities has risen for the second year running. There have been  35,960 applicants to nursing and midwifery courses at English universities in 2020 – a 6% rise compared to 2019.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:   


  As Health Secretary, I’m determined to deliver on our commitment to have 50,000 more nurses in the NHS.

  So I’m delighted that figures out today show that alongside a reduction in vacancies and an increase in the number of GPs, we’ve got record numbers of nurses working in our NHS – up by over 8,000 on the same time last year.

  This government is determined to make good on its commitments and deliver on the people’s priorities – and today’s figures show that we are doing just that.

19/08/2019,The next round of applications for the Local Digital Fund is now open.,"
    
          Councils looking to improve public services through innovative uses of digital technology can apply for funding from today (19 August 2019), Local Government Minister Luke Hall MP has announced.

Grants of up to £350,000 will be invested in projects from the government’s Local Digital Fund. 

Projects bidding for the Fund of up to £7.5 million must be shared by councils working together to explore how digital technology can improve public services for residents in innovative ways.

Ideas could range from making people’s lives easier with more efficient, online ways to pay for services or get help, to embracing tech to support vulnerable people or making bin collections, social housing repairs and taxi licensing services more efficient.

Minister for Local Government, Luke Hall MP, said:


  Digital technology is transforming our lives. From smart tech at home to apps on our phones, it’s helping us to stay connected and making things easier.

  Councils are on the front line of exploring how we can harness technology to improve services while saving taxpayers’ money.

  Today we’re opening up the next round of applications for the Local Digital Fund. I would encourage all councils with innovative ideas that focus on residents’ needs to apply.


Sixteen projects were awarded grants of up to £100,000 last year, with 57 councils working in teams to shape new digital services and explore the potential of modern technology.

Projects included exploring how virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa can improve the lives of people in need of care, improving online tools for reporting social home repairs, and using data analytics and artificial intelligence to produce education plans for children with special needs.

Other areas of research included giving frontline social workers better access to information to make crucial decisions and improving software used by council planning departments.

For the projects, lead councils across the country partner with at least 2 other councils to share knowledge and ideas. This collaborative approach is a key pillar of the government’s Local Digital Declaration, launched last year, to coordinate public bodies seeking digital solutions.

The Fund is also being invested in digital skills and digital leadership training for council staff.

19/03/2019,Updated advice for UK travellers on the continuity of reciprocal healthcare arrangements in the event of a no-deal EU Exit.,"
    
          Leaving the EU with a deal remains the government’s top priority and would give all UK nationals the stability and certainty to prepare for our new relationship after EU Exit. However, the government must plan for every possible outcome, including no deal.

Today, we are updating UK nationals on the Department of Health and Social Care’s plans for the continuity of reciprocal healthcare arrangements in the event we exit the EU without a deal.

All UK nationals who are planning to reside in, travel to, work or study in the EU or European Free Trade Area (EFTA) states (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland) are strongly advised to check the country-specific guidance on GOV.UK and NHS.UK about healthcare arrangements if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.

The Department of Health and Social Care has been working closely with EU member states and EFTA states to protect existing healthcare arrangements for these and other groups. However, it is not possible for the UK government to guarantee access unilaterally to healthcare abroad.

Actions for UK nationals

Visitors to the EU

The government always advises UK nationals to take out travel insurance when going overseas, both to EU and non-EU destinations. UK nationals, including those with pre-existing conditions, planning to visit a country in the EU/EFTA on exit day should continue to buy travel insurance.

Any questions regarding individual travel insurance policies should be directed to the relevant insurance companies or refer to guidance published on the Association of British Insurers (ABI) website. 

Residents in the EU

Substantial numbers of UK nationals will already be eligible for or enrolled in local health services, because of their residency, benefits or employment status. There is no reason to think that a no-deal scenario will affect these arrangements where EU countries offer equal access to healthcare.

UK nationals resident in the EU are advised to register their healthcare entitlement with their local authorities, if they have not already done so. This may mean that they will need to join a social insurance scheme and contribute as other residents do. Others will need to buy private healthcare insurance.

The UK government’s offer

In order to continue to support the healthcare needs of UK nationals, we have made an offer to EU member states and EFTA states to maintain the existing healthcare arrangements, in both a deal or no-deal scenario, until 31 December 2020.

This would mean that we will continue to pay for healthcare costs for current or former UK residents for whom the UK has responsibility who are living or working in or visiting the EU.

We have brought forward legislation to enable us to implement new reciprocal healthcare arrangements.

Although we are hopeful that EU member states will accept our offer, as a responsible government we have developed a multi-layered approach to minimise disruption to healthcare provision for UK nationals currently in or travelling to the EU:

some EU member states have prepared their own legislation for a no-deal scenario. Spain has publicly committed to healthcare access for resident and visiting UK nationals
  the UK and Ireland are committed to continuing healthcare access within the Common Travel Area
  the UK has already agreed with EFTA states to protect citizens’ rights, including healthcare
  the UK will fund healthcare for UK nationals who have applied for, or are undergoing, treatment in the EU prior to and on exit day, for up to one year
  we have published country-specific guidance on GOV.UK and NHS.UK
  UK nationals may use NHS services if they return to live in the UK
  those who have their healthcare funded by the UK and are resident in the EU on exit day can use NHS services in England without charge when on a temporary visit
  the ABI has advised that travel insurance policies will cover emergency medical treatment costs that could have been reclaimed through European Health Insurance Cards (EHICs)
If EU member states do not agree to extend the existing healthcare arrangements before exit day, many of the arrangements for access to healthcare in the EU would change for UK nationals. Healthcare arrangements in many member states would revert to those that apply to the rest of the world.

In a no-deal scenario, UK nationals may no longer be able to use their EHICs when travelling to the EU.

04/04/2019,"A ground-breaking ceremony at Nesscliff Training Camp, near Shrewsbury in Shropshire, has marked the beginning of construction for new on-site, state-of-the-art, kitchen and dining facilities for military personnel undertaking pre-deployment training across the estate.","
    
          A £4 million investment will see the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO), its industry partner Landmarc Support Services Limited and local building contractor Pave Aways Limited, deliver an enhanced facility capable of feeding 600 armed forces personnel each meal time and up to 200 personnel in the field. It will also include additional storage and welfare space and improve the current disabled facilities on the site.

Designed to meet the mandated 60-year life span for all new buildings, with enhanced thermal insulation and photovoltaic roof panels, the project supports the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Sustainable MOD Strategy and will significantly reduce ongoing maintenance and utilities costs for the MOD.

The project is expected to have a positive impact on the local economy by sustaining around 300 jobs locally.

DIO Training Safety Officer, Major (Ret’d) Richard Slaney, commented:


  DIO supports our armed forces by providing what they need to live, work and train. Nesscliff is a core site for military training within the West Midlands and surrounding counties, dealing with all priority military units’ pre-operational training. With the changes in regular army basing and the increase in UK-based troops, the new kitchen and dining facility will allow Nesscliff to support the inevitable increase in use, whilst providing the high quality service troops expect and deserve.


John Shippen, Landmarc’s Project Manager added:


  As DIO’s industry partner for the delivery of services across the national Defence training estate, we’re proud to be managing a project that will provide improved welfare facilities for our armed forces.

  Not only will the new facilities enable an enhanced training experience for end users but they will be sustainable too, with far more efficient utilities, photovoltaic roof panels and better insulation, which will reduce running costs. We are also partnering with local contractors to provide additional employment and business opportunities for local people.


Steven Owen, Managing Director of Pave Aways, said:


  As the local contractor, we are delighted to be building this important facility at Nesscliff, which is where we secured our first ever contract 45 years ago.

  We estimate that the scheme will sustain more than 300 jobs through Pave Aways and our supply chain and are committed to working with contractors and sub contractors that are based within a 25-mile radius so it will have a positive impact on the local economy.

    Location of intervention
      Various cities across England
    Contractor/delivery partner
      Living Streets, Transport for Greater Manchester, Birmingham City Council, West Yorkshire Combined Authority, Merseytravel and West Midlands Combined Authority
    Scheme implementation dates
      2016 to 2017 – 2019 to 2020
    Cost of scheme
      £2.62 million from 2016 to 2017 and 2019 to 2020
    Funding source
      Department for Transport
    BCR
      2018 to 2019 programme
    Why we did it

Travelling to education is the most common single purpose of walking journeys but there is huge potential to increase the proportion of children walking to school. A generation ago, 70% of primary school children walked to school but this has dropped to just over half (51%).

The government has a target in its Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy (CWIS) to have 55% of primary school children walking to school by 2025.

How we did it

Living Streets, with support from the Department for Transport, has been running the Walk to School Outreach (WTSO) project since 2017. It does so mainly through behaviour change interventions delivered in schools, including WOW, Living Streets’ year-round walk to school challenge, and by influencing local infrastructure decisions.

News story: Government announces new funding to get more children to walk to school

What we did

Over the period 2018 to 2019 the WTSO project promoted walking in 275 primary schools including 133 new schools. The project is estimated to have encouraged around 10,000 extra children and around 2,500 extra adults to walk to school over this period.

What impact did it have

Final evaluation carried out at the end of March 2019 shows that walking rates increased by 38% among new WTSO project schools and increased walking rates were sustained in existing schools in 2018 to 2019. This represents around 4 million new walking trips and 1.3 million fewer school run car journeys in that year with total vehicle miles reducing by around half a million. This will lead to considerable transport, environmental and health benefits, with an estimated benefit-cost ratio of 10.

14/07/2022,"On Tuesday 12 July, senior Cabinet Ministers awarded young people and employers for their contribution to tackling high youth unemployment through the Kickstart Scheme, as the country recovered from the pandemic.","
    
          Launched in September 2020, the scheme secured over 163,000 jobs for young people nationwide as part of the government’s drive to help those aged 16-24 start their career and gain vital work experience.

At an awards ceremony in Lancaster House on Tuesday 12 July, six young people were awarded for their outstanding contribution as recognised by their employer, while 16 employers were recognised for their work in supporting young people out of the pandemic.

The Kickstart Awards come as the latest data shows that 7 out of 10 young people had earnings four months after their Kickstart job ended, showing its success in providing young people with the right skills to enter the labour market.

Unemployment is now at an almost 50 year low, and when the Kickstart Scheme ended in March, youth unemployment was the lowest since records began.

Recipients of the awards included a young woman from Surrey who worked in a women’s support centre supporting victims of domestic abuse, and a young Scottish man trained by his employer in AI development.

Some of the roles on offer by shortlisted employers included film making, archaeology, landscape architecture, animal sanctuary support and hospitality.

Kickstart provided a crucial lifeline to businesses, with many keeping young people on in permanent roles, including through apprenticeships. And many of these businesses have continued to work with their local jobcentres through the Way to Work scheme, which saw half a million more people move into work in five months earlier this year.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:


  Our Kickstart Scheme has transformed the lives of thousands of young people, giving them their vital first step into the workplace and the confidence to develop skills, while businesses have benefitted from fresh talent, energy and enthusiasm.

  I want to congratulate all those who have made a success of this fantastic programme, with many still in work today, and I want to thank all the employers who joined us on our mission to invest in the next generation and help ensure unemployment stays at its near 50 year low.



Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Thérèse Coffey said:


  Kickstart has been a huge success for our young people with over 163,000 of them having a first taste of work after a challenging time in the pandemic. With around 30,000 still on the scheme, most Kickstart graduates are still in work, which is fantastic news. I’d like to thank every business that worked with us to create opportunities and improve the prospects of a generation of talent.


Looking ahead, ministers have renewed their focus on supporting those with additional barriers get into work, so that everyone, no matter their age or career stage, has access to a stable and rewarding career, utilising the national network of jobcentres.

People are now being supported by their jobcentre to progress, helping them to earn more money, get more hours, and use their experience as a springboard for their career, while boosting economic growth to address the cost of living.

27/06/2022,"Broadband and mobile firms commit to do more to help customers cope with global price rises
","
    
          
Customers who can no longer afford their bills will be offered help to stay connected
  Digital Secretary urges anyone struggling to speak to their provider following No 10 summit co-chaired by cost-of-living tsar David Buttress
The UK’s biggest broadband and mobile operators have agreed to a raft of new commitments to further help customers with the rising cost of living following a government-led summit at No 10 Downing Street.

These include measures such as allowing customers struggling with bills to move to cheaper packages without charge or penalty, or agreeing manageable payment plans, and options to improve existing low cost offers and increasing promotion of existing deals.

The measures, put forward by the government in consultation with the industry, will ensure people struggling with bills due to the economic aftermath of the pandemic and war in Ukraine can continue to make calls, send texts and get online.

Bosses representing the vast majority of the UK telecoms market - including BT Group, Openreach, Virgin Media O2, Vodafone, Three, TalkTalk and Sky - signed up to the pledges at an event chaired by Digital Secretary Nadine Dorries and Cost of Living Business Tsar David Buttress today.

The commitments, which take effect immediately, are:


    All providers commit to supporting their customers who may be struggling with the cost-of-living and to treat them with compassion, understanding and as individuals.
  
  
    All providers commit to supporting customers struggling with their bills and to offer ways to keep them connected, such as allowing them to move to cheaper packages without charge or penalty, or agreeing manageable payment plans.
  
  
    All operators commit to continue to protect the connectivity of their customers known to be vulnerable as a priority.
  
  
    Providers - supported by Government - commit to take steps to raise awareness of low cost products to those claiming Universal Credit.
  
  
    Mobile providers commit to considering more ways to help their customers, including exploring tariffs, options to improve existing low cost offers, and increasing promotion of existing deals.
  
The government has already taken action to help those on benefits access cheaper deals by negotiating social tariffs for those on Universal Credit which are now available across 99 per cent of the UK, but this latest intervention means anyone struggling to pay their broadband or mobile bill as a result of global price rises can expect support from their provider if they ask for it.

Digital Secretary Nadine Dorries said:


  Families across the country face increased anxiety about keeping up with bills, so today I agreed with broadband and mobile industry bosses what more can be done to support people during this difficult time.

  I’m pleased to report the industry is listening and has signed up to new commitments offering customers struggling with the cost of living help to stay connected. Those who need support should contact their supplier to see what is available.


Commenting on the meeting, Chief Executive at Mobile UK, Hamish MacLeod, said:


  Mobile operators welcome the commitments agreed upon today with the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, which build on offers already in place to help the most vulnerable. We welcomed the chance to discuss with the Government not only how to raise awareness of such schemes but also to set out the further steps being taken to support those struggling with their bills.


Andrew Glover, Chair of the Internet Service Providers’ Association, said:


  The telecoms sector knows that people are facing real challenges with the cost-of-living crisis. Our members are determined to do what they can to help their customers through this period and, together with government, we will work to raise greater awareness of the support available.

  These commitments, along with the social tariffs that are available from many members, will hopefully help people in need at this challenging time. We encourage customers who are struggling with their bills to reach out to their broadband provider to get help.


The Digital Secretary has been calling on all providers yet to offer social tariffs - discounted broadband and mobile deals for people on Universal Credit and other benefits - to step up and support their customers. She has called on broadband providers that do offer social tariffs to do more to raise awareness of them, after Ofcom data showed less than two per cent of eligible people are taking up these discounted offers.

In a letter sent in April to the bosses of BT Group, Virgin Media O2, Hyperoptic, KCom, G.Network and Community Fibre, she asked for an outline of their plans to promote social tariffs and for estimates of take-up over the coming twelve months. These companies all offer social tariff products to low-income households, with some providers offering deals from as low as £10 per month. Vodafone - via its Voxi brand - recently launched the first mobile social tariff.

Social tariff offers are available to eligible people in 99 per cent of the country and could represent a saving of more than 50 per cent (around £180 per year) against the average cost of broadband.

Landline and broadband social tariffs have been offered by BT, Virgin Media O2 and KCom for several years, but since 2021 there has been a threefold rise in companies voluntarily offering their own social tariffs - with Sky, Now Broadband, County Broadband and others coming forward - after the government stepped in to negotiate the low-cost deals.

01/09/2022,£24 million for services that work with women in justice system.,"
    
          

Female offenders to be diverted from life of crime with targeted support
  Women helped to get off drugs, off the streets into work


Women whose crimes have been fuelled by addiction, mental health issues and domestic violence will be better supported to stop reoffending thanks to new government funding.

With over 60 per cent of women in prison having experienced domestic abuse and 50 per cent having drug addictions almost £21 million will be invested in women’s services to tackle the causes of female offending and cut crime.

Organisations such as Working Chance, the UK’s only charity dedicated to getting women with convictions into work, support offenders who are serving a community sentence or have recently been released from prison and may be at risk of reoffending.

This tailored support, which can range from help to find a job or support with drug and alcohol abuse, can provide stability in getting their lives back on track – ultimately helping to keep the public safe.

Without specialist support in the community, statistics show that half of women who have been in prison will go on to reoffend, contributing towards the £18 billion cost of reoffending to the taxpayer.

A further £3.6 million will be allocated to help local services, such as mental health support and drug experts, work more closely together to support female offenders. This will include funding local coordinator roles, who would help to bring government and third sector organisations together to provide a better service.

Prisons Minister Stuart Andrew said:


  Female offenders are often driven into crime by poor mental health, drug addiction or abuse.

  This investment will make sure we support women facing these problems away from crime and into the help they need to get their lives back on track.


Tackling the root causes of female offending and providing vulnerable women with early support is a key part of the Female Offender Strategy, with many women who commit low-level crimes being driven by underlying factors such as substance abuse, trauma or difficulty in getting a job.

Katie, 39, who spent 6 months in prison and has been helped back into employment through Working Chance, said:


  Mounting debt and mental health issues all contributed towards my offending, but I was determined to take responsibility and start getting my life back on track.

  Working Chance gave me the support needed to rewrite my CV, prepare for interviews and the confidence to disclose my convictions to potential employers.


While women who commit the most serious crimes will always be sent to prison, custody should always be a last resort. On top of the £24 million funding, the government is also piloting a £10 million Residential Women’s Centre in Swansea, to reduce the number of women sent to prison.

Female offenders at the centre will receive one-to-one mental health therapy and counselling to address their trauma from previous abuse and support to overcome substance misuse.

This is alongside plans to pilot a new Problem-Solving Court targeted at women with complex needs, including drug and alcohol abuse.

Female offenders sentenced at the court will see the same judge or bench of magistrates for regular reviews, receive intensive support and supervision from the Probation Service and have access to services for drug and alcohol abuse, and support with housing, training and employment.

Since 2018, almost £55 million has been invested to support female offenders. New specialist staff have been recruited to support pregnant women and mothers in prison, and charities and community organisations have also received funding to keep services running.

08/04/2021,British National (Overseas) families coming to the UK on the Hong Kong BN(O) route will benefit from a dedicated package of support to help them settle successfully into life in the UK.,"
    
          

Hong Kong BN(O) status holders and their families who settle in the United Kingdom will receive £43 million dedicated support package
  12 welcome hubs will help families and individuals access housing, education, and employment to build a life in the UK
  Funding for councils to provide additional help for new arrivals where needed, including support with housing costs and learning English
  Schools to receive dedicated Hong Kong educational resources to teach pupils about historic Hong Kong-British connection


British National (Overseas) families coming to the United Kingdom on the Hong Kong BN(O) route will benefit from a dedicated package of support to help them settle successfully into life in the UK, the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick announced today (8 April 2021).

Backed by over £43 million, the Hong Kong British Nationals (Overseas) Integration Programme will help status holders access housing, work and educational support to ensure they are able to quickly integrate and contribute to their newfound communities.

The move delivers on the UK’s historic and moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong who chose to retain their ties to the UK by taking up BN(O) status in 1997. It provides them with a pathway to live in the UK should they choose to do so. BN(O) status holders have had their rights and freedoms restricted by the National Security Legislation imposed by the Chinese government and it is right that we change the entitlements in the UK which are attached to their status.

Councils in England, who are already playing a key role to ensure BN(O) status holders are warmly welcomed and supported, will benefit from £30.7 million to provide targeted support for new arrivals, covering additional English language and support with housing costs for those who need it. As the areas of support covered by these funds are both devolved policies, £5.8 million will be provided to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to deliver similar activity.

A further £5 million will be used to establish 12 virtual welcome hubs across every region in England, and in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to co-ordinate support and give practical advice and assistance in applying for school places, registering with GPs and even setting up businesses.

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said:


  I want to extend a warm welcome to Hong Kongers arriving in the UK and reaffirm that this government is doing everything in its power to ensure your success and happiness here.

  This programme will ensure British National (Overseas) status holders and their families have the very best start as soon as they arrive, and support to help them find a home, schools for their children, opportunity and prosperity.

  We are a champion of freedom and democracy and will live up to our responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong, so that these families will come to find the UK a place they can call home.


Home Secretary Priti Patel said:


  We promised to uphold freedom for the people of Hong Kong, which is why I am proud that we have been able to support so many people when they have needed our help.

  It’s an unprecedented and generous scheme and there is no other visa in the world of this nature. We are working hard to successfully resettle people here and recognise there is nothing more difficult than leaving your home to rebuild a life in a new country.

  I know communities up and down our country will welcome new arrivals with open arms and support them to build a new life in the UK.


Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said:


  This is another important step in our support for BNOs to help them integrate and contribute to UK society.

  It reflects our commitment to the people of Hong Kong – and those who have now chosen to start a new life here.


Dr Krish Kandiah, Founder of UKHK.org said:


  The arrival of Hong Kongers will enrich the UK immensely and help thousands  of people live in freedom.

  All of us – neighbours, colleagues, fellow students, businesses – have important roles to play in making Hong Kongers feel welcome and to help their integration into British society. But government support is critical. That’s the clear lesson from past migrations. So it is great to see the government follow through on its commitment to help Hong Kongers successfully settle in the UK with an early package of assistance.


Today’s package also includes:

12 ‘virtual’ welcome hubs for new arrivals with funding for projects like local helplines, community led activities such as buddying up with other families, and English language support if needed, ensuring that people feel at home in their new community.
  A £986,000 national Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE) grant scheme will fund national projects that support BN(O) status holders in areas such as employment, mental health and wellbeing to help build community cohesion.
  As a part of the VCSE fund, MHCLG will develop dedicated Hong Kong educational resources for schools so that they can teach young people about our historic connection and commitment to Hong Kong and its people and, celebrate the contribution of the Hong Kong-British and Chinese-British Diaspora to the UK.
  Dedicated advice for BN(O)s and a comprehensive welcome pack to help BN(O) families navigate the move. This includes information on how to access public services, registering to vote and opening a bank account, pointing to local amenities like libraries and leisure centres and promoting the UK’s rich cultural, arts and music events, all translated into Cantonese.
To help drive integration work across government, the Communities Secretary has established an Inter-Ministerial Group that will consider issues such as access to public services, opportunities and safety for new arrivals across all four nations.

The UK’s offer of bespoke immigration route BN(O) status holders follows the Chinese government’s imposition of the National Security Law in Hong Kong last year.

Today’s package shows the UK will not look the other way on Hong Kong, and that this government will deliver on its historic responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong.

04/11/2022,"Thousands of troubled youngsters will be put back on the right track thanks to a new £5 million fund for crime-cutting sports schemes, the Deputy Prime Minister has announced today (4 November 2022).","
    
          

£5 million to keep youths away from crime through sport
  Charities bid to fund grass-roots activities teaching resilience and discipline
  Part of largest youth justice funding package in a generation - making streets safer


Charities across England and Wales will be able to bid for new money to run programmes designed to steer young people away from law-breaking and into positive activities aimed at teaching teamwork, resilience and discipline.

While the number of young people in custody remains at a record low, statistics show around 80% of prolific adult offenders begin committing crimes as children – with the economic and social costs of reoffending costing the taxpayer an estimated £18 billion per year.

The new funding announced today builds on the government’s work to catch and prevent youth offending earlier than ever – helping to prevent these young people becoming involved in crime or anti-social behaviour.

Earlier this year, the Deputy Prime Minister announced the biggest funding package in a generation to tackle youth offending and cut crime, including £60 million for early intervention.

Today’s news also delivers on the commitment made in the Prisons Strategy White Paper – published in December last year – to introduce further measures for early intervention to cut youth crime, keep streets safe and create fewer victims.

Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Dominic Raab, said:


  I have seen first-hand how local sports projects can transform the lives of young people from tough backgrounds, getting them off the streets and teaching them life skills including teamwork, discipline, and resilience.

  That’s why we’re investing £5 million in innovative sporting schemes up and down the country. It is part of our £300 million investment to support every council across England and Wales in catching and preventing youth offending earlier than ever, making our streets safer.


Charities and organisations wanting to deliver the sports programmes will be able to bid for the money – with hundreds of organisations expected to benefit from the funding.

The Ministry of Justice will work closely with its delivery partner – StreetGames and consortium partners the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice and the Sport for Development Coalition – to oversee the application process and delivery of the funding.

Stuart Felce, StreetGames Director of Sport and Community Safety, said:


  We’re really excited to be partnering with the Sport for Development Coalition and the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice to deliver this ambitious new programme from the Ministry of Justice.

  These funds are a vote of confidence in the power of sport to provide young people with a positive pathway and to help prevent them from falling into the criminal justice system.


Notes to editors
StreetGames and the Ministry of Justice will open the bidding competition on Monday 7 November. It will run until Monday 5 December.
  More information on the Ministry of Justice’s previous Youth Justice funding announcement.
  Two additional organisations with deliver the fund in conjunction with StreetGames and the Ministry of Justice. These are the Sport for Development Coalition, a membership organisation of partners who use sport to tackle key health and societal inequalities, and the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice, a charitable incorporated organisation that seeks to act as a change agent for the impact of sport in the Criminal Justice System.

15/05/2020,"Ministry of Justice owned Facilities Management company, Gov Facility Services Ltd (GFSL), has been giving offenders a chance to gain valuable work experience since it opened for business in early 2018.","
    
          Over that time GFSL has provided around 1.7million hours of meaningful work experience to offenders in 35 of the 50 prisons across the South of England where the company provides facilities management services.

The work schemes are overseen <U+200B>by GFSL staff and include general painting and decorating, basic plumbing, electrical, carpentry, handyperson and stores activities. <U+200B>As well as providing beneficial work experience, these schemes help maintain the general condition of the prisons, while saving the prisons service time and money.

GFSL Chief Executive Paul Ryder said:


  At some sites we have refurbishment programmes where a member of GFSL staff oversees a team of residents, at others we operate more of a ‘buddy up’ type system where we match our trades with one resident worker each <U+200B>who may already have experience in a specific skill or trade. Our placements and schemes vary from site to site but we are proud to offer on-the-job experience and try to help in the rehabilitation of offenders.



  GFSL has also started to work closely with the <U+200B>The <U+200B>New Futures Network (NFN), a national network created to increase the number of prisoners in employment on release and working in prisons in England and Wales. <U+200B>This has led to the business recently opening up a number of vacancies across the open estate to ex-offenders. I’m delighted to say that we are also in the process of offering permanent employment to one of our ROTL (Released on Temporary License) team members who are coming to the end of their sentence. On release this individual should move straight from the ROTL team into permanent employment with GFSL.


Much of this work falls under the Clean, Rehabilitative, Enabling and Decent (CRED) scheme where residents actively contribute to improving their environment. The scheme aims to offer meaningful work experience and employment support to prisoners to help improve their employment prospects when they leave prison.

The programme also aims to involve prisoners in helping to improve living conditions in the prisons so they meet the safe and decent standards set by HMPPS.

Notes to editors:

Gov Facility Services Limited (GFSL) is a Ministry of Justice owned company. Set up in 2018, we work closely with Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) to deliver a range of facility services to 50 prisons in the south of England.

Case studies:

Bristol Refurbishment of D-wing

The refurbishment of D-wing began in September 2018 and focused on the complete refurbishment of all cells, the replacement of flooring, the upgrade of showers and food service, and the modernisation of the wing offices. This investment was particularly exciting because of the use of ‘resident’ (offender) tradespeople in the project design.

The scheme moved beyond the traditional approach of keeping residents involved in the lower skilled areas of delivery, to a scheme that provided the successive development of their skills and work experience and full integration into the workforce.

A key feature of the refurbishment programme was to take a consistent approach to the decoration of prisoner accommodation in creating a bright and safe environment. In recent years, the absence of a coordinated approach, has resulted in a mixture of colours being used to paint prisoner accommodation.

The project was successfully delivered using a high contingent of resident labour and helped to address significant issues on the wing. It also helped improve standards and has given prison staff a greater opportunity to hold prisoners to account in respect to maintaining standards of decency.

Hard at work at HMP Hollesley Bay

HMP Hollesley Bay has a resident working programme where <U+200B>sixteen<U+200B> <U+200B>risk-assessed residents work on an enhanced programme. <U+200B><U+200B>This means they are cleared to work as members of the GFSL team across a small portfolio of sites during the normal working day.

This includes all trades dealing with reactive work including plumbing and electrical work as well as painting and decorating.

The residents recently stepped in when staff members had to self-isolate because of Covid-19.

GFSL Site Manager Richard Lummis said:


  At different points we had either all electricians or all plumbers isolating at Hollesley Bay and the residents from the work scheme stepped in to keep things running. The team is lucky enough to include an 18th edition electrician along with plumbers. The residents have worked alongside the GFSL team and have the site knowledge to step in and cover.


This team also recently completed (February 2020) a shower refurbishment at the prison which saved HMPPS over £30,000 when compared to the outsourced cost projection.

The team also completed refurbishment projects at HMP Bedford visits centre and at Stirling House Training and Conference Centre which is the main unit for training new prison officers. At Stirling House, the team have replaced bathrooms and bedrooms.

Also at Hollesley Bay, one of the resident carpenters also supported a project to build a Coffee shop on site with all profits being donated to a charity for veterans. This has been so successful that the charity is looking at offering the carpenter full time employment at the end of his sentence.

In all such cases the resident ROTL worker is offered an enhanced rate of pay and assistance in the development of their personal portfolio to support future employment engagements. They are supervised by GFSL staff and make a valuable contribution to the ongoing maintenance and minor refurbishment activities within the estate.

Improving living conditions at HMP Pentonville

At HMP Pentonville, GFSL staff work with up to 18 residents<U+200B> <U+200B>as part of an ongoing cell refurbishment programme. This work includes general painting, decorating and minor repair works. This team will shortly be running a training programme designed to teach residents how to lay resin floor.

Similar programmes are planned at HMP The Mount where our staff will be trained in laying vinyl flooring. They will then pass on this knowledge to the residents.

All who complete the course will receive formal certificates of competence and will be used to support all such future works on site.

Once in place these initiatives will help provide further cost saving to HMPPS and the taxpayer.

Keeping the prison spick and span at HMP Swaleside

HMP Swaleside has a resident working programme delivering the painting programme. Led by the on-site GFSL Painting Supervisor, there are normally around 13 residents on the programme.

To date, this programme has continued to deliver works to a high quality and ahead of plan. The team is hoping to expand this service to include handyman tasks during the summer.

Pilot programme at St Catherine’s Priory Approved Premises in Guildford

A recent pilot project at an Approved Premises in Guildford gave one of the residents a fresh start and a realistic chance to rebuild his life.

Lawrence worked alongside the GFSL team on the complete refurbishment of four buildings. Work included internal decoration, replacement of flooring and small repairs.

This project provided a real-life working environment for Lawrence who delivered services in line with expected industry standard (pics attached). Health and safety training was also provided as part of this initiative.

MOJ Chief Estates Officer Andy Mills said:


  After reviewing risk assessments and being sure that suitable measures were in place, Lawrence began working as part of the team to redecorate living accommodation. Lawrence has been extremely keen and worked to a very high standard. He was also very happy to gain the experience and confidence from doing the work.

more than 3,100 criminals fitted with alcohol-monitoring tags in a year
  offenders stayed sober 97% of the time
  move to cut booze-fuelled crime which costs society £21 billion


Since the tags were launched as part of government plans to curb drink-fuelled crime, 3,121 offenders have been monitored by the tags, with more than 3,000 staying sober.

Alcohol plays a part in 39 per cent of all violent crime in the UK, and the social and economic cost of drink-related harm is estimated to be around £21.5 billion per year.

As a result of the scheme’s success, the Ministry of Justice will roll out alcohol-monitoring tags to other offenders once they are released from prison in the summer. Further details will be announced in the coming months.

By 2025 it is estimated that 12,000 offenders will have had their drinking monitored by the tags – part of the Government’s £183 million expansion of electronic monitoring.

Minister of State for Crime and Policing Kit Malthouse said:


  We are ramping up our use of this innovative technology because it is working, with offenders staying sober 97 per cent of the time.

  It is not only protecting the public from the scourge of alcohol-fuelled crime - it also gives probation officers the chance to work with offenders to help them turn their lives around.


Since last April, courts have been able to order offenders to wear an alcohol tag as part of a community sentence when their crime was driven by alcohol. The tag takes a sample of their sweat every 30 minutes and alerts the Probation Service if the offender has been drinking.

Those found breaking their ban can face a prison sentence and fines.

Roughly 20 per cent of offenders supervised by the Probation Service have an alcohol problem. The service provides professional support to offenders with an alcohol misuse issue, monitoring risk and helping them address their consumption while also linking them into specialist help.

Mark*, aged 44 from Hereford, was sentenced to a Community Order, and required to wear an alcohol-monitoring tag for 90 days after being arrested for drink driving. He has also been banned from the road for 30 months and received 100 hours Community Payback.

Mark said:


  I was pulled over on a Saturday morning and was devastated to blow over the limit. Like many others, during lockdown a drink at the weekend had turned into maybe a glass of wine during the week and it made me reflect.

  I’ve not found wearing the tag hard, but it has given me extra motivation to reduce my intake.


The government is investing £183 million into the expansion of electronic monitoring. As well as sobriety devices, GPS monitoring equipment is now deployed across 19 police force areas – roughly half of England and Wales - so that burglars, robbers and thieves that have served a prison sentence of a year or more are tagged on release. Their whereabouts will be monitored by GPS satellites for up to 12 months.

*Mark is not the offender’s real name.

25/08/2022,"Prior to the merger, Veolia and Suez were 2 of the largest suppliers of waste management services in the UK.","
    
          The CMA has today required Veolia to sell 3 businesses after an in-depth merger investigation concluded the merger gives rise to competition concerns in a number of markets.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has concluded that Veolia must sell substantial parts of the merged business:


    Suez’s UK waste management services businesses;
  
  
    Suez’s UK industrial water operation and maintenance services business; and
  
  
    Veolia’s European mobile water services business.
  
These businesses make up almost all of the overlap between Veolia’s and Suez’s competing operations in the UK.

In response to the provisional findings of the Phase 2 inquiry, Veolia said that it would sell the UK Suez waste business. The CMA will determine the conditions of the sale, as well as the sales of the 2 water services businesses.

The CMA will need to approve the purchasers of each business before the completion of each sale.

Veolia and Suez are both global players in waste and water management. In 2020, the companies generated approximately £2bn and £1bn in the UK respectively – roughly 10% and 7% of their annual global revenues.

Veolia and Suez are active across the full waste management supply chain. They collect waste from households and businesses, sort it for recycling and composting and dispose of the remaining waste – some of which is incinerated to produce electricity. Many local authorities in the UK rely heavily on either Veolia or Suez to meet their waste management needs. The companies also supply water and wastewater management services to industrial customers.

Throughout the investigation, the CMA heard from a number of councils  and customers who were concerned about the potential impact of the merger on the cost and quality of the services they receive. Ultimately, taxpayers and businesses would have been left to cover any increase in cost.

Stuart McIntosh, Chair of the CMA inquiry group, said:


  Local authority budgets are already under strain, and this deal is likely to lead to them paying more and receiving a lower-quality service. The negative impact would have ultimately fallen on taxpayers at a time when they are feeling the pressure of the cost of living crisis.

  Given our concerns about the merger, we have concluded that Veolia must sell most of the operations it took over in the UK when it acquired Suez. We will now work with Veolia to ensure that appropriate buyers are found so that businesses, councils – and ultimately taxpayers – will not lose out.


The CMA’s final report, published today, confirms its provisional findings issued in May. It rules that the merger would lead to competition concerns in 5 waste markets and 2 water treatment markets. In each of these markets, the merging businesses currently compete closely and would face limited competition after the merger. The CMA found that this would be likely to result in higher cost or lower quality services for councils, with knock-on effects for taxpayers, as well as businesses across the UK.

The CMA launched an investigation into the deal between Veolia and Suez in October 2021. The transaction was referred for an in-depth Phase 2 review, which is led by an independent inquiry group, in December 2021.

This deal has been reviewed by a number of competition authorities across the world. Major divestments were also required in the EU and in Australia.

    For media enquiries, contact the CMA press office on 020 3738 6460 or press@cma.gov.uk.
  
  
    The CMA found that the merger would lead to a Substantial Lessening of Competition (SLC) in the following areas:
  

    Collection of non-hazardous waste for municipal customers;
  
  
    Operation and maintenance of material recovery facilities (i.e. sorting of waste after collection) for municipal customers;
  
  
    Operation and maintenance of Energy Recovery Facilities (i.e. incineration) for municipal customers;
  
  
    Supply of incineration services to customers in 2 local areas;
  
  
    Collection of non-hazardous waste for commercial and industrial customers;
  
  
    Operation and maintenance of water and wastewater treatment facilities for industrial customers; and
  
  
    Provision of mobile water services to industrial customers.

17/12/2020,"Fund announced to help end the scandal of excessive waking watch costs, as part of a further move to support thousands of residents in high-rise buildings.","
    
          

New £30million Waking Watch Relief Fund for fire alarms to reduce costs for leaseholders forced to have a waking watch
  £1 billion Building Safety Fund deadlines extended to ensure more eligible buildings can remove unsafe cladding
  Around 95% of buildings with dangerous ‘Grenfell type’ ACM cladding to have completed remediation or have workers on site by the end of the year


The government has today (17 December 2020) announced a £30 million fund to help end the scandal of excessive waking watch costs, as part of a further move to support thousands of residents in high-rise buildings.

The new Waking Watch Relief Fund will pay for the installation of fire alarm systems in high-rise buildings with cladding, removing or reducing the need for costly interim safety measures such as ‘waking watch’.

The National Fire Chiefs Council have been clear in recent guidance that building owners should move to install common fire alarm systems as quickly as possible to reduce or remove dependence on waking watches.

The steps today will help worried leaseholders who may have faced high costs for interim safety measures by providing financial support and delivering a better, long term fire safety system in their buildings.

Some buildings have already installed these systems due to the significant savings this offers, with leaseholders in those buildings, who on average were paying £137 per month for a waking watch, expected to collectively save over £3 million per month.

The same research shows the wide range in costs faced by leaseholders and evidence of disproportionate charges – the Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick is writing to Trading Standards asking them to use their powers to investigate.

The fund will open in January, but will also provide immediate, emergency support to Wicker Riverside Apartments in Sheffield to ensure that the 35 recently evacuated families should be able to return to their homes before Christmas.

A 6-month extension to the deadline for building owners to complete their applications to the £1 billion Building Safety Fund has also been announced - with a new deadline for submissions of 30 June 2021.

This means hundreds more buildings will be remediated and thousands of leasehold residents will be protected from costs. Progress is being made on current applications with many more expected to be agreed before Christmas.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said:


  I’ve heard first-hand from leaseholders the misery that rip-off waking watch costs have been bringing to residents of high-rise buildings with cladding.

  I’m announcing today a £30m Waking Watch Relief Fund to help relieve the financial pressure on those residents and to ensure they are safe. I’m confident that this will make a real difference to worried leaseholders up and down the country this Christmas.

  We have continued to prioritise the removal of unsafe ACM cladding throughout the pandemic and expect around 95% of remediation work will have been completed or be underway by the end of this year.


National Fire Chiefs Council Chair, Roy Wilsher said:


  We welcome this new Waking Watch Relief Fund, which will help to reduce the financial burden for some leaseholders having to fund the costs of waking watches.

  It has been our firm and long held expectation that building owners should move to install common fire alarms as quickly as possible and this funding is a positive step.


Building Safety Minister Lord Greenhalgh said:


  Our priority is making sure people are safer in their homes and we are working tirelessly to make this happen.

  The measures announced today build on our commitment, which will be enshrined in law through our Building Safety Bill, to improve the safety of buildings across the country.

  Building owners are responsible for making sure that their buildings, and the people who live in them, are safe. We continue to actively pursue them to encourage swift action and have supported this with £1.6 billion in government funding.


This builds on steps the government has already made to support leaseholders including securing an agreement that owners of flats in buildings without cladding do not need an EWS1 form to sell or re-mortgage their property - benefitting nearly 450,000 homeowners.

These measures are part of the government’s commitment to improve the safety of buildings across the country which will be enshrined in law through the Building Safety Bill in 2021.

The government is clear the building industry must contribute towards the costs of making these homes safe once more, to set right decades of unsafe practices.  Work continues at pace to develop further financial solutions to protect leaseholders with details to be announced in the new year.
"
16/07/2020,Victims of terror atrocities at home and overseas are to benefit from a new dedicated compensation scheme under government plans to boost the support offered to people injured by violent crime.,"
    
          

government to consult on new compensation process for victims of terror
  part of wider proposed reforms to simplify and improve criminal injuries compensation
  increased pay-outs for bereaved families


The proposals aim to better address the particular needs of victims and their families following a terrorist incident, and ensure applications are processed as rapidly as possible. The changes follow a commitment to improve the compensation process following the Manchester Arena Terror Attack, and support the government’s wider review of the support available to terror victims, including families and loved ones, to ensure more victims get the support and advice they need, faster.

The plans form part of a package of reforms Ministers are pursuing through a consultation launched today (16 July 2020) which seeks to improve the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS) – making the scheme simpler and more transparent, while ensuring it keeps pace with the changing nature of crime.

The Scheme provides compensation to victims injured by violent crime as public acknowledgement of their suffering, paying out more than £130 million last year – making it one of the most generous of its kind in the world. This includes £11 million to victims who were previously barred from accessing compensation under the pre-1979 ‘same roof’ rule after the government scrapped the unfair rule last year.

The key proposals in the consultation include:

Creating a standalone scheme for victims of domestic and overseas terrorism to improve awareness of the support on offer and ensure applications are processed as rapidly as possible.
  Scrapping completely the ‘same roof’ rule which blocks victims from receiving compensation if the attacker was a family member they were living with at the time of the incident. Ministers abolished part of the rule in 2019, which has led to £11 million being paid to victims previously denied compensation.
  Simplifying the list of injuries included in the CICS and the tariff of payments associated to them.
  Giving a single payment to bereaved families of £8,000 – an increase of £2,500 for the majority of applicants while speeding up the claims process.
  Increasing support for funeral costs to a single payment of £4,500 - from the previous basic sum of £2,500 to reflect the rise in funeral costs.
  Seeking views on whether families bereaved by homicide abroad should have access to compensation.
Justice Minister Alex Chalk said:


  All too recently we’ve witnessed the devastating effects of terrorism, which is why this government is determined that victims get the support they need to rebuild their lives.

  While no amount of compensation can ever make up for the suffering they’ve endured, our reforms will ensure the system for claiming awards better reflects the needs of victims, and that applications are processed as rapidly as possible.

  But this is only one part of our plans to boost the support available for people injured by violent crime. We are simplifying the Scheme making it easier to understand, as well as increasing pay-outs for bereaved families.


Today’s announcement follows a comprehensive review which found that for the vast majority of applicants the  Scheme is working well, with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) which operates the Scheme reporting a 95% customer satisfaction rating.

The review concluded that the principles underpinning the Scheme must be maintained – that it exists to support all eligible victims of violent crime who have suffered the most serious injuries, and that compensation is an important and public recognition of their ordeal. It carefully considered the Scheme’s scope and eligibility criteria, and while it recognised concerns around application time limits and the unspent conviction rule, it found that any change would undermine the Scheme’s ethos of treating all victims in a fair and consistent manner.

However, the review revealed some areas where improvements could be made, including to reduce the complexity of the process – which can deter some from applying – as well as enhancing the support offered to victims. Ministers are therefore consulting on package of changes which would inform the detail of a new and improved Scheme.

The move builds on commitments to improve the support on offer at every stage of the justice system outlined in the first-ever cross-government Victims Strategy as well as a raft of reforms to protect victims and pursue perpetrators. This includes:

a 50 per cent increase in funding for victims of sexual violence.
  abolishing the pre-1979 ‘same roof rule’ which has paid out £11 million to new and past applicants.
  consulting on a new Victims Code setting out what support victims should expect from the justice system.
  Improving court environments, with new victim-friendly waiting areas and an emphasis on accessibility for the most vulnerable.
  Extending the Unduly Lenient Sentence so more victims and the public can have sentences reconsidered by the Court of Appeal.
Notes to editors

The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (the Scheme) is a statutory scheme that exists to compensate victims of violent crime in Great Britain where no other option of financial redress is available.
  A consultation will run from 16 July to 9 October 2020.
  The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) deals with over 30,000 applications a year, and has a high satisfaction rating of 95% from applicants who had been in contact in 2018/19.
  In 2018/19 the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) paid out more than £130 million to victims.
  The review examined whether the Scheme remains fit for purpose, reflects the changing nature of violent crime and effectively supports victims in their recovery.
  It considered:
    The scope of the Scheme, including the definition of violent crime for the purposes of compensation for injury, and the type of injuries that are covered by the Scheme.
      The eligibility rules including, among other things, concerns about time limits for making applications, unspent convictions, and consent in sexual offences cases.
      The requirements of the Scheme in relation to decision-making, including issues such as the level of evidence required for compensation claims, and the timeframes for accepting or rejecting awards.
      The value and composition of awards available through the Scheme, including the balance struck between serious and less serious physical and mental injuries.
      The impact of the Scheme on particular groups, including victims of child sexual abuse and victims of terrorism.
      Opportunities to simplify the Scheme.
      The affordability and financial sustainability of the Scheme.
    
  The Scheme operates a tariff-based system for determining injury awards which describes the qualifying injuries and the associated awards. Our proposals will simplify this list of injuries and awards to achieve more transparency and consistence for victims.
  ‘Same roof’ rule
    The rule was intended to ensure perpetrators would not benefit from compensation paid to victims they lived with.
      In 2019 the pre-1979 ‘same roof’ rule was abolished. This meant victims of violent crimes which took place before 1979 were blocked from receiving compensation if the attacker was someone they were living with at the time of the incident.
      However, the post 1979 ‘same roof’ rule remained intact. The changes recommend abolishing this rule completely, so that familial relationships will not prevent victims from accessing compensation to which they would otherwise be entitled, provided that there is no possibility of the assailant benefitting.
      An amended Scheme coming into force on 13 June 2019. The changes allow victims previously denied criminal injuries compensation under the rule, or who have never applied, to make fresh applications; applications must be received by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) within two years, by 13 June 2021.
    
  Victims of domestic terrorism can already claim from CICS and Victims of FCO-designated terrorist attacks abroad can claim compensation from the Victims of Overseas Terrorism Compensation Scheme.
  A standalone scheme for victims of terrorism would require primary legislation.
  The consultation also explains rationales for not changing certain aspects of the Scheme. This includes:
    The scope of the Scheme and whether it could be extended to include crimes of grooming, online exploitation and grooming.
      The review found that expanding to such crimes could present operational difficulties given the wide range of other offences that may also have similar harmful impacts and operation difficulties in establishing evidence.
    
  The government is also reviewing the wider support available to victims of terrorism, including families and loved ones, and investing £500,000 to increase the support provided, to ensure more victims get the support and advice they need, faster.
  The Home Secretary made an announcement on the 26 March regarding a competed grant, available to organisations who want to provide support to victims of terrorism. Organisations were able to bid for up to £500,000, to provide advice and support to individuals and their families affected by terrorist attacks. The outcome will be announced shortly.
  The government has committed to an internal review of the wider support package available to victims of terrorism. The review is currently being scoped and we will take forward its recommendations in due course.

26/05/2020,New fund will meet the cost for unsafe non-ACM cladding on residential buildings that are 18 metres and over and do not comply with building regulations.,"
    
          

Building owners urged to register for the government’s £1 billion fund to remove and replace unsafe non-ACM cladding systems on high-rise residential buildings.
  Fund takes total government funding for cladding remediation to £1.6 billion
  Sprinkler systems to be provided in all new blocks of high-rise residential buildings over 11 metres.


Building owners have been urged to act and put the safety of residents first as the government’s £1 billion Building Safety Fund to remove dangerous cladding was launched today by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP.

It comes as the government has today (26 May 2020) published the prospectus for the fund which will meet the cost for remediation of unsafe non-ACM cladding systems on residential buildings in the private and social sector that are 18 metres and over and do not comply with building regulations.

This fund is predominately targeted at supporting leaseholders in the private sector facing significant bills. However, the government is clear that for leaseholders living in buildings owned by providers in the social sector, it will provide funding to meet the provider’s costs which would otherwise have been borne by leaseholders. The government expects landlords to cover these costs without increasing rent for their tenants.

The government’ is already providing £600 million for the replacement of ACM cladding systems bringing total funding for remediation up to £1.6 billion.

Ministers have been clear that they expect building owners who are already remediating their buildings should continue to do so. They should explore every opportunity to fund this work before seeking funding from government or passing on costs to their leaseholders.

The fund’s application process has been designed to enable projects to proceed at pace with building owners, freeholders or others responsible for the building urged to register for the fund on Monday as applications can be progressed alongside the development of the remediation project.

It comes as the government has also published an amendment to the statutory guidance to building safety regulations – otherwise known as Approved Document B. These changes will ensure sprinkler systems and consistent wayfinding signage are mandatory in all new high-rise blocks over 11 metres tall when they come into force.

The Housing Secretary, mayors and local leaders have also pledged to ensure vital building safety improvements continue during the coronavirus pandemic.

This will ensure the safety of those living in high-rise buildings with unsafe cladding or insufficient fire safety measures is prioritised.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP said:


  Today I am launching our £1 billion fund to remove unsafe non-ACM cladding from buildings. This is work that must take place as an absolute priority to keep residents safe and brings total funding for remediation up to £1.6 billion.

  I will not accept any excuses from building owners who have yet to take action and those responsible should register for the fund so that they can start the remediation process immediately. I have also reached an agreement with local leaders so that this important work can continue safely during the pandemic.

  New statutory guidance published today also means that all new residential buildings over 11 metres tall will be fitted with sprinkler systems. This is another critical part of our commitment to delivering the biggest changes to building safety for a generation.


Building Safety Minister Lord Greenhalgh said:


  Now that this additional £1 billion funding is in place, building owners must crack on with removing flammable cladding on all high-rise residential buildings that are over 18 metres.

  The government will work with the Mayor of London and our Metro Mayors as well as local councils to ensure that these vital building safety works are finally carried out, so that people are safe in their homes.


Our Fire Safety Bill, which was introduced to Parliament last month, will empower fire and rescue services to take enforcement action and hold building owners to account if they do not comply with law.

19/03/2020,"The funding will help patients who no longer need urgent hospital treatment to return home, making at least 15,000 beds available during the coronavirus outbreak.","
    
          The funding comes from the £5 billion COVID-19 fund announced by the Chancellor in last week’s budget. 

£1.6 billion will go to local authorities to help them respond to other coronavirus (COVID-19) pressures across all the services they deliver. This includes increasing support for the adult social care workforce and for services helping the most vulnerable, including homeless people. 

£1.3 billion will be used to enhance the NHS discharge process so patients who no longer need urgent treatment can return home safely and quickly. 

The funding will cover the follow-on care costs for adults in social care, or people who need additional support, when they are out of hospital and back in their homes, community settings, or care settings. 

Enhancing the NHS discharge process will help free up 15,000 hospital beds across England and ensure more staff have capacity to treat people needing urgent care, including those being cared for with coronavirus.

This funding is part of the government’s commitment to ensure NHS and social care system, and other public services, have all the resources they need during the COVID-19 outbreak.

The government will continue to monitor pressures in the NHS and local government and will keep reviewing future funding.  

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: 


  Our NHS and social care colleagues are at the heart of protecting the most vulnerable during the coronavirus outbreak, and the whole country is tremendously grateful for their commitment during this challenging time.

  This funding will help the NHS and social care services in our communities to rise to this once in a generation challenge by allowing the NHS to do what it needs to, and help move people out of hospital as soon as possible to get them back home with the right support.

  We are clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect lives and protect our NHS.


Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said: 


  I’ve been clear that the NHS and other vital public services will receive whatever they need to protect people from coronavirus. 

  Our £5 billion budget response fund is now being used to free up more beds in hospitals and ensure some of our most vulnerable people are getting the care they need. The government will continue to lay out comprehensive and coordinated responses to get this country through this situation.


Local Government Secretary, Robert Jenrick said:


  The work of local authorities to deliver social care and other vital public services has never been more important than it is now – and will be – in the days and weeks ahead.

  That’s why we’re giving local councils £1.6 billion of additional funding to spend where it’s needed most, to ensure they can meet the cost of the increased demand for social care, and continue to protect the most vulnerable people in society.

17/06/2020,A pioneering scheme to provide new antibiotics to NHS patients by offering to pay pharmaceutical companies upfront for their work will start this week.,"
    
          Government offers contracts to develop new antibiotics to treat deadliest diseases
  NHS patients could benefit from new antibiotic treatments as early as 2022
  New drugs will be paid for by world’s first ‘subscription-style’ payment model for antibiotics
The NHS is offering 2 contracts to pay pharmaceutical companies at the start of their work for access to innovative antibiotics, incentivising them to bring new classes of the drugs to patients across the UK for the first time in almost 30 years.

Of particular interest are antibiotics that can provide alternative treatment options for serious infections, such as bloodstream infections, sepsis and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The high cost and low returns associated with antibiotic research and development makes it commercially unattractive. This is why the drugs will be paid for by the world’s first ‘subscription-style’ payment model for antibiotics and will be made available to UK patients as soon as possible, potentially as early as 2022.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:


  The incredible discovery of antibiotics nearly 100 years ago transformed the health of our nation and our ability to combat infections. Diseases that were once a death sentence are now treated in just one small step.

  But resistance to antibiotics is increasing and it’s imperative we take urgent action on a national and global scale to protect future generations.

  This new way of buying antibiotics for patients in the NHS breaks down restrictive barriers to offer companies a vital springboard to foster innovation and develop potentially life-saving new products.


Professor Dame Sally Davies, UK Special Envoy on Antimicrobial Resistance, said: 


  Antibiotics underpin modern medicine and are integral for global health security. Governments and industry must work together to produce new antibiotics and ensure that we can continue to treat common diseases.

  The UK is leading the way by encouraging companies to produce new antibiotics to stay one step ahead of life-threatening diseases.


The payment model, which was launched in July 2019, will pay pharmaceutical companies upfront for access to their antibiotic product, based on a product’s value to the NHS, rather than how much is used.

This aims to incentivise companies to invest in researching and developing new antibiotics, helping secure much-needed alternative treatment options for NHS patients.

Two drugs that have proven to be both safe and effective will be selected to undergo health technology assessment (HTA) by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) throughout 2021 using adapted methods for antimicrobials. The HTA will be used to decide the level of the subscription payment.

From this week, suppliers can register their interest for the scheme on NHS England’s eTendering Service.

The UK is at the very forefront of the global fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR), launching its 5-year national action plan in 2019 and setting out its vision for AMR to be contained and controlled by 2040.

Yet, tackling AMR will require a global effort and the government is today calling for other countries to offer similar incentives in their own domestic markets.

Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director, NHS England said:


  Staff across the NHS are already working with patients to ensure the antibiotics we have are used in the right way at the right time, and this new scheme is further important progress to develop new, life-saving antimicrobial medicines.

  People’s lives depend on us having effective antibiotics and steps like this further reinforce how the NHS is leading the way in efforts to safeguard against the rise of superbugs.


Professor Gill Leng, Chief Executive, NICE, said:


  We are witnessing the effects of one global pandemic, which has highlighted the threat of communicable disease.  Alongside the threat of coronavirus is the increasing risk posed by antimicrobial resistance, exacerbated by a sparse antimicrobial development pipeline.

  That is why we need to incentivise investment in innovative antimicrobial drug development as soon as possible. Along with our key partners, we have committed to develop and test innovative models for the evaluation and purchase of antimicrobials, applying advanced evaluation methods that recognise their full value to public health.

  We hope that this project will inspire healthcare systems across the world to consider adopting similar models so that collectively, we deliver meaningful incentives that reinvigorate the global antimicrobial pipeline.


Background information

The need to address the urgent issue of bringing new antimicrobials to market is widely recognised. Few new classes of antibiotic have been discovered since the 1980s and, for most antimicrobials, there are few replacement or alternative products in development and even fewer that target priority pathogens.
  The high cost and low returns associated with research and development of novel antimicrobials makes it commercially unattractive. In addition, pharmaceutical company revenues depend on volume of sales, potentially undermining antimicrobial stewardship initiatives.
  The UK is the first country in the world to announce it will test innovative models that pay companies for antimicrobials based primarily on a health technology assessment of their overall value to the NHS, as opposed to the volumes used.
  The subscription-style payment model will mean the NHS will have new drugs to call on when needed, while companies will be able to reliably forecast the return on their investment.
  A notice will be published on the Official Journal of the European Union website in the next 2 to 5 days.
  Once the notice is live, suppliers can register their interest via https://nhsengland.bravosolution.co.uk. Instructions and selection criteria will be published as part of this notice. Once released the procurement documents can also be found on the NICE website.
  Two procurement exercises will be run in parallel: one for an antimicrobial recently introduced to the UK market, and a second for a new antimicrobial with plans to launch in the UK before January 2021.
  The selection process has been designed to favour products which meet a key need in the UK while also addressing disease areas of international importance. Points will also be awarded for degree of novelty, surety of supply, the supplier’s demonstrated commitment to antimicrobial and environmental stewardship, and commitment to support surveillance.
  Products will be selected by the end of this year, and these selected products will progress to the HTA stage in 2021 to estimate the value of each product to the NHS. Contracts for the 2 antibiotic products are due to start in April 2022.
  The scope of the current procurement is the NHS in England. The expectation is that, if the project is successful, future rollout of these purchasing arrangements could be UK-wide.

07/10/2019,"Vulnerable people across England received almost 13 million extra hours of home visits from social care workers last year, new statistics show.","
    
          Vulnerable people across England received almost 13 million extra hours of home visits from social care workers last year as part of a £674 million government funding programme, new statistics show.

The Improved Better Care Fund (iBCF) works to connect the NHS and local council care services so people can manage their own health and wellbeing and live independently in their communities for as long as possible.

As well as increasing the number of home care hours, the funding provided in 2018 to 2019 also helped to support the social care market by enabling councils to increase the fees paid to social care providers by more than 4%.

This additional funding forms part of an additional £2 billion for councils to deliver adult social care from 2017 to 2020, announced at Spring Budget 2017.

Local Government Minister, Luke Hall MP, said:


  Councils are on the frontline caring for some of the most vulnerable people in our society and we are determined to continue supporting them in this vital work.

  We have listened to their feedback and I am delighted our funding has provided almost 13 million extra hours of care at home, improving people’s quality of life and giving them greater independence.


Minister for Care, Caroline Dinenage MP, said:


  We are determined to ensure people are able to access good quality, compassionate care by better joining up councils and health services.

  The Improved Better Care Fund has had a huge impact on local communities ensuring more of our most vulnerable in society are getting the help and support they need to stay living at home for longer and ensuring the local care market stays sustainable.


The Improved Better Care Fund is:

helping to keep people living independently at home
  reducing delayed discharges across the social care system
  achieving closer working between the NHS and social care services
Health and Wellbeing Boards, which coordinate the provision of social care in 150 areas in England, reported progress from money spent to meet adult social care needs, reducing pressure on the NHS, and support the social care market.

The Boards have reported that this year’s funding has:

paid for almost 75,000 extra home care packages (providing almost 13 million additional hours of home care)
  paid for over 15,500 additional care home placements
  enabled councils to increase fees paid to social care providers for home care, residential care and nursing care in 90% of Health and Wellbeing Board areas; resulting in home care fee rates increasing by 4.7%, residential by 4% and nursing home fee rates by 4.1% compared to 2017 to 2018
  helped to reduce pressures on the NHS by tackling delayed transfers of care – freeing up hospital beds – through supporting more people to be discharged from hospital when they are ready, with 122 projects last year
As announced at the Spending Round, next year local government will have access to an additional £1 billion grant for adults and children’s social care, on top of existing social care funding (which includes the iBCF).

This government is also consulting on a 2% precept which would give councils access to a further £500 million for adult social care next year.

01/11/2019,"Funding will be available to partner organisations, including charities, from April 2020 to help vulnerable people claim Universal Credit.","
    
          Secretary of State Therese Coffey has today (1 November 2019) announced a £10 million Universal Credit Transition Fund for outreach programmes to help vulnerable people make Universal Credit claims.

The fund will be available to partner organisations across the UK, including charities, from April 2020. It will aim to help vulnerable people, including disabled people, care leavers and those with mental health issues, claim Universal Credit as a route into work. It will support innovative ideas for engaging with vulnerable people early, helping them to make timely claims to the new benefit.

Figures show that a fifth of claimants delayed making a claim for Universal Credit, largely because they didn’t know how to make a claim or because they thought they would find a job quickly.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Dr Therese Coffey MP said:


  I am delighted to announce a £10 million challenge fund to support the most vulnerable in society with their Universal Credit claims.

  Universal Credit is now supporting more than 2.5 million people. Around 1 million disabled households are better off under Universal Credit and we will continue to deliver targeted support through this fund and other measures.


The £10 million funding was allocated to DWP as part of the 2019 Spending Round process.

Other help for vulnerable people

DWP is providing severe disability payments (SDP) to protect the most vulnerable. Severely disabled claimants can receive SDP to support their living costs as they move onto Universal Credit. This is worth a maximum of £405 a month to claimants – worth £600 million over the next 6 years for 45,000 claimants.

Around 1 million disabled households will receive an average of around £100 more per month through Universal Credit.

11/06/2020,A consultation event is being held via zoom for the local community about plans to protect properties in Skeldergate from flooding,"
    
          People living in the Skeldergate area of York are being invited to take part in a virtual consultation event next week to find out more about plans to better protect the area from flooding.

Environment Agency staff are holding the event on Thursday 18 June, at 6.30pm, to answer any questions from residents and business representatives about proposals to offer protection to individual properties against the risk of flooding. The protection will include fitting products such as flood doors, barriers and airbrick covers to properties that are found to be suitable following a free survey.

These products known as Property Flood Resilience (PFR) are used to reduce the risk of flood water getting in to homes or businesses and, in some instances, to reduce the damage if it does get in.

A study was carried out by consultants employed by the Environment Agency, as part of the York Flood Alleviation Scheme, to look at the best option for reducing flooding in Skeldergate.

Some of the options examined by the consultants were constructing floodwalls along the Ouse, waterproofing building walls and fitting floodgates across the access points from Skeldergate to Queens Staith. The study looked at the benefits of each option in terms of the numbers of properties protected and compared to the development and construction costs. It concluded that the only viable option to reduce the risk of flooding in Queens Staith and Skeldergate is to provide PFR measures to eligible properties.

Initially the plan was to hold a public drop-in event to share the findings with the local community but due to Government guidance on social distancing restrictions relating to the coronavirus outbreak, a decision has been made to trial holding an event remotely.

The virtual live event will be held using the Zoom platform. The details are: 
Meeting ID: 837 5064 2927
Password: YorkB7
Or use this link

If you have any questions about the meeting email: yorkfloodplan@environment-agency.gov.uk

Mark Fuller, flood risk adviser with the Environment Agency, said:


  Although we cannot currently meet members of the local community in person, we are still keen to give them the opportunity to speak to our project team about the results of our findings and discuss any concerns with us. Our priority is the health, safety and wellbeing of residents and staff.



  Flooding can never be eliminated entirely, but by using property flood protection we may be able to reduce the risk of water getting in to homes or businesses and reduce its impact if it does get in.


There have been 40 residential and 10 commercial properties in the Queens Staith and Skeldergate area identified as being eligible for a free PFR survey to look at what measures are recommended as offering the best protection. If owners want to go ahead with the recommendations they will be offered a grant of up to £7,500 to install resistance measures to their properties.

This work forms part of £45 million York Flood Alleviation Scheme, which will better protect 2,000 homes in the city from flooding.

Progress continues to be made with the construction of York Flood Alleviation Scheme as work is being carried out where safe to do strictly adhering to Government guidelines. Every effort is being taken to ensure any delays caused by the effects of the pandemic are kept to a minimum.

13/01/2020,"Around 900,000 people across the UK could see their Housing Benefit payments rise from April.","
    
          The freeze on Local Housing Allowance rates that has been in place since 2016 has today (13 January 2020) been lifted by the Minister for Welfare Delivery, meaning that rates will rise by inflation from April.

There are around 1.4 million people in the private rental sector receiving Local Housing Allowance, and this change will provide an average of around £10 extra a month to affected households in the private rented sector.

And since 2011, the government has provided local authorities with over £1 billion in Discretionary Housing Payments to protect the most vulnerable claimants. An additional £40 million was also made available for next year’s Discretionary Housing Payment fund to help affordability in the private rented sector.

Minister for Welfare Delivery, Will Quince, said:


  This government is levelling up opportunity across the UK, and this will be a welcome increase for around 900,000 people as we provide more money to help pay for housing.

  We are committed to tackling all forms of homelessness - ending the freeze on housing benefits is just one part of achieving this. We have announced an additional £263 million to help councils provide better support to homeless people, and importantly, prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place.

  We will continue to work with the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government, and others across government, to find ways to support the cost of living in the rented sector.


This announcement follows a commitment to end the benefit freeze made in November, which means other benefits will also rise by inflation.

Millions of people on Universal Credit, as well as those on the old benefits system, will also see their payments rise by inflation. 

What do people need to do to receive the increase?

Payments will increase automatically – they do not have to apply to receive the extra cash and should see a change in their housing payments after 1 April 2020.

12/03/2019,"A radical reshaping of financial advice services used by pension schemes for long-term investment strategies will benefit millions of savers and boost the nation’s £1.6 trillion retirement assets, under plans unveiled by the government today (12 March).","
    
          Opening up the market for financial advice services used by pension schemes will help trustees get better value for money, boost members’ retirement funds and reduce employers’ shortfalls, according to ministers.

A Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) probe into investment strategy advice accessed by pension schemes found trustees were often denied clear information which would help them when weighing up options – hitting retirement incomes.

Now the government is acting to:

improve competition in financial advice services used by trustees of both defined contribution (used by the majority of pension savers) and defined benefit pension schemes
  ensure better disclosure of fees and performance
  encourage closer trustee engagement when buying such services
  enable more effective monitoring of compliance by The Pensions Regulator
Guy Opperman, Minister for Pensions and Financial Inclusion – welcoming the CMA’s findings – said:


  Changes we are proposing will have a positive impact on millions of people’s pension pots.

  The market sometimes restricts trustees’ ability to find the best value for money, meaning that defined benefit schemes are less affordable and more difficult to fund while defined contribution schemes face higher costs and reduced returns for members.

  We want trustees to be better equipped and engaged when accessing services which have a huge influence on decisions affecting how much their members will have to live on in retirement.


The Department for Work and Pensions plans to consult on proposals later this year.

07/02/2020,Engaging employees and supporting employers to increase walking rates.,"
    
          

      
    Location of intervention
      10 local and combined authorities across England
    Contractor/delivery partner
      Living Streets on behalf of Blackpool Council (lead authority) and councils in Buckinghamshire, NECA (Durham), Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Surrey, Leicester, Stoke-on-Trent, North Lincolnshire and West Sussex
    Scheme implementation dates
      April 2017 – March 2020
    Cost of scheme
      £7,498,000
    Funding source
      Department for Transport
    BCR
      6.4:1
    Why we did it

Increasing walking to work positively impacts the health and wellbeing of employees by encouraging them to be more physically active. It benefits all employees by reducing congestion and carbon emissions around the workplace whilst the employer and local economy benefit from raised productivity (for example, by reduced absence).

How we did it

Walk To is part of the Access Fund and works with 3 key audiences – workplaces, schools and post primary education settings. Living Streets, as the lead delivery partner, is working with all 3 audiences to increase walking rates, tackle barriers to walking and reduce congestion.

Part of the project is an awareness-raising and behaviour change programme in workplaces. Alongside this, public realm improvements will help create walking-friendly routes.

What we did

To date, Living Streets has supported 95 unique workplaces across a range of settings including council offices, universities, hospitals and private sector companies such as NEXT in Leicester.

The interventions delivered have reached an average of 1,300 employees per year and include promotional campaigns, walking pledge events, led walks, walk leader training sessions and one-to-one walking advice sessions.

Living Streets has also developed new approaches to better engage employees, and support employers in embedding a walking culture in their workplace. This has led to the launch of the new Walking Works package in February 2019.

What impact did it have

Participant surveys carried out in April 2019 indicate that 59% of respondents meet their walking pledge regularly. Furthermore, 72% of respondents said they now walk a lot (19%) or a bit (53%) more than they used to. On average, those who walked more attributed about half of the change to Living Streets activities.

10/02/2023,Thousands of prisoners are getting clean thanks to a doubling of drug-free wings in jails as the government’s war on addiction steps up a gear.,"
    
          

thousands of prisoners join drug-free wings as war on addiction ramps up
  up to 100 special blocks in prisons by 2025 alongside abstinence-based units
  new wings and tough security to clean up prisons and cut crime


New Incentivised Substance Free Living Units are now up and running in 45 prisons across England and Wales - getting addicts off illicit drugs and reducing their reliance on synthetic opiates like methadone.

Figures show around half of prisoners are addicted to drugs, while crack and heroin addicts account for two-thirds of shoplifting offences and half of burglaries, blighting communities up and down the country.

Yet offenders who are supported to get off drugs for good are 19 percentage points less likely to slip back into a life of crime.

The new wings will make sure prisons are places where criminals get – and stay – clean while they pay their debt to society, instead of languishing on drug substitutes like methadone which can hinder their rehabilitation.

Today’s news, alongside tough new security including X-ray body scanners, forms a cornerstone of the government’s strategy to break the cycle of addiction and re-offending which costs the tax-payer £19 billion a year.

Deputy Prime Minister, Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor, Dominic Raab, said:


  We are clamping down on drugs behind bars with tough new security, but we know reducing supply is not enough to break the cycle of addiction and offending.

  Our new drug-free units and drug recovery wings will help prisoners tackle their addictions, including to opiate substitutes like methadone, in turn cutting their risk of reoffending and creating safer streets.


The government is also investing in up to 18 drug recovery wings where prisoners can go through 6 months of intensive abstinence-based treatment to break their reliance on methadone as well as dangerous substances.

On the new incentivised units, offenders will tackle their addictions through substance misuse courses and regular drug testing

In exchange, prisoners who are making progress towards getting clean receive extra time out of cell for education and work opportunities and, once they’ve turned their back on drugs for good, including substitutes like methadone, the prospect of being transferred to a drug recovery wing for 6 months of intensive, fully abstinence-based treatment.

09/02/2023,New materials published by the CMA remind employers to brush up on competition law and avoid illegal collusion,"
    
          The CMA has published new easy-to-read materials, which seek to boost business compliance and remind employers of their legal obligations to avoid collusion when it comes to employee pay, working conditions and the hiring of staff.

Employers across the United Kingdom are required to comply with competition law when setting wages and working conditions for new and existing employees, as well as policies on staff recruitment and retention. This helps ensure successful candidates and existing staff are paid fairly for their work and can opt to move to another employer where pay and conditions are better.

The new materials cover no-poaching agreements, where businesses agree not to hire each other’s employees; wage-fixing agreements, where businesses who compete for the same types of employees fix salaries; and information sharing about the terms and conditions of employees’ contracts.

It includes practical pointers for businesses to comply with the law, such as:

understanding how competition law applies to no-poaching and wage-fixing agreements
  training HR staff on competition law and how it applies to agreements within recruitment
  ensuring internal reporting processes are in place so staff can report no-poaching agreements or wage-fixing
Juliette Enser, CMA Senior Director of Cartels, said:


  When it comes to labour markets, breaking competition law won’t just negatively impact staff and potential recruits – who rightly expect their employers to play by the rules, as they cope with the rising cost of living – but could result in large fines or the disqualification of directors if you are caught.

  Businesses have no excuse for not following the law and ignorance is no defence when it comes to colluding with competitors to rig the labour market in their favour.

  The materials we published today will help ensure all employers understand their responsibilities under competition law and sets out how the CMA will take action against those who engage in anti-competitive behaviours.


Notes to editors


    The new guide for employers on how to avoid breaking competition law was published by the CMA on 09 February 2023.
  
  
    If you’ve witnessed an illegal business cartel or been involved in one, you can do the right thing by reporting it to us: If you’ve seen something: call us on 020 3738 6888 or email cartelshotline@cma.gov.uk. If the information you provide leads to an investigation, you may earn a reward. If you have been involved: tell us and you may get leniency. Call us on 020 3738 6833 and we can provide confidential guidance.
  
  
    Following a CMA investigation, a business found to have breached competition law could be subject to significant financial penalties of up to 10% of their annual worldwide turnover. Individuals participating in illegal collusion can also face significant personal fines, imprisonment and be disqualified from their role.  This disqualification can last up to 15 years, seriously affecting business options.

08/11/2022,The purchase of student accommodation provider Student Roost by GIC and Greystar could lead to higher rent and lower quality housing for students in Birmingham.,"
    
          The Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) phase 1 assessment looked at how the proposed deal could impact students and universities across the UK, focusing on cities where GIC, Greystar and Student Roost have a significant combined presence.

The CMA found the acquisition would not lead to competition concerns in most cities because the combined businesses would continue to face sufficient competition from other accommodation providers. But in Birmingham, the CMA found that the combined businesses would not face enough competition across several university campuses, potentially resulting in higher prices and lower quality services for students.

GIC, Greystar and Student Roost have accepted the acquisition could raise competition concerns in Birmingham and intend to offer remedies to fully address them. The CMA expects to receive their formal proposal within the next 5 working days. Provided the proposed remedy addresses the CMA’s concerns, the merger will be cleared without the need for an in-depth phase 2 investigation.

Colin Raftery, Senior Mergers Director at the CMA, said:


  Aside from fees, rent is the biggest expense students face, and the rising cost of living is putting even more pressure on student budgets.

  Many university towns and cities are already dealing with a student accommodation shortage, which is why it’s crucial that private providers like those involved in this deal are competing effectively.

  We’re concerned this deal could result in students in Birmingham seeing higher prices or lower quality services. GIC, Greystar, and Student Roost have accepted our concerns and have told us that they plan address them. A solution that fully resolves our concerns will avoid the need for a more in-depth investigation.


For more information visit the GIC Realty / Greystar / Student Roost case page.

Notes to editors:

A detailed summary of the CMA’s decision is available on the case page. The full text of the decision setting out the CMA’s investigation and analysis will be published in due course.
  The CMA’s competition concerns relate to 15 university campuses in Birmingham.
  The parties have until 15 November to submit proposals to address the CMA’s competition concerns. The CMA would then have until 22 November to consider whether to accept these in principle or refer the deal for an in-depth phase 2 investigation.
  All enquiries from journalists should be directed to the CMA press office by email on press@cma.gov.uk or by phone on 020 3738 6460.

27/10/2021,"Land Trust charity benefits by £30,000 to improve environment.","
    
          Inspectors found excessive amounts of sludge had been spread without notification
  Two other companies issued with Variable Monetary Penalties
The Environment Agency has accepted an Enforcement Undertaking (EU) from a company who spread excessive amounts of sewage sludge on land near Doncaster contrary to the Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 2016.

The Environment Agency also issued variable monetary penalties (VMPs) totalling over £10,000 to 2 other companies for breaches of the Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulation 2015.

The EU has been agreed after Sanderson Environmental Ltd were found to have breached conditions of their environmental permits for 2 fields at Highwood Farm, near Rossington, Doncaster. This follows an investigation which began in 2017.

The company, who operated on the land, have paid costs of £8,137.36 and have made a donation of £30,000 to the Land Trust, a registered charity which works to improve former coalfield sites across Yorkshire.

When officers from the Environment Agency inspected the farm to check compliance with environmental permits they found that excessive amounts of sludge had been imported.

They also found that spreading had occurred to land on a large scale without notification to the Environment Agency. Enquiries revealed that the sewage sludge had not been treated prior to spreading.

When challenged by Environment Agency officers the company eventually stopped operating and all remaining stockpiled sewage sludge was removed. A crop of contaminated peas planted in error by the landowners was destroyed.

Two companies who own the fields in question were issued with VMPs for breaches of the Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulation 2015.

Sutcliffe Farmers Limited paid £7,521.54 and Senviro Limited paid £2,507.73, with each also paying costs of £8,137.63. A VMP is a proportionate monetary penalty for the more serious cases of non-compliance.

A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said:


  We take our responsibility to protect the environment very seriously. Where there is evidence, the Environment Agency uses a full range of enforcement options.

  Enforcement Undertakings allow businesses who fail to comply with legal requirements or pollute the environment to come into compliance.

  The Environment Agency is increasingly using this method of enforcement where there is opportunity to restore and improve the environment, change behaviour and improve practices of the offender.

  We rely on communities to report pollution and environmental issues to us, and urge people to report issues to us on our 24 hour incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60.


Euan Hall, the chief executive for The Land Trust, said:


  This award has made a huge difference to the sites on our South Yorkshire portfolio.

  We have already been able to deliver a number of projects which have been of huge benefit to the communities that live and work around our sites.

  We are very pleased to have been able to help the Environment Agency undo some of the damage that had been done and make improvements that will benefit the local area for the long-term.


Notes to editor

What is an enforcement undertaking (EU)?

An EU is available to the Environment Agency as an alternative sanction to prosecution or monetary penalty for dealing with certain environmental offences.

It is a legally-binding voluntary agreement proposed by a business (or an individual) when the EA has reasonable grounds to suspect that an environmental offence has occurred.

EUs for environmental offences were introduced under the Environmental Civil Sanctions (England) Order 2010 and the Environmental Civil Sanctions (Miscellaneous Amendments) (England) Regulations 2010.

Why use enforcement undertakings?

businesses will voluntarily secure compliance now and in the future, without attracting a criminal record
  the environment, local community and those directly impacted by the offending can benefit through actions being offered in an EU
  they allow us to deal with the less intentional and polluting offending in a more proportionate way than prosecution through the criminal courts
  EUs go beyond the bare minimum needed for a business to comply, as shown in the list of accepted EUs we publish on our website
How can businesses benefit from enforcement undertakings instead of prosecution?

Accepting an EU is always at the discretion of the EA. But if accepted replaces the need for an alternative sanction, such as prosecution or monetary penalty.

The EA has produced guidance and standard forms to help those wishing to make offers.

However, we expect responsible businesses to co-operate and seek our advice at an early stage, as we are more likely to accept EUs which have been offered early or proactively.

When offering an EU, businesses must accept responsibility for the offending.

They must also include actions which will stop offending, ensure future compliance and protect any harm/damage.

They must also make a financial contribution towards a suitable environmental project.

What is a variable monetary penalty (VMP)?

A VMP is a proportionate monetary penalty for the more serious cases of non-compliance.

How much is a VMP?

The maximum amount for any VMP is £250,000 for each offence.  The exact amount is calculated using the methodology in Annex 1 of our Enforcement and Sanctions Policy.

When can VMPs be used?

A VMP can be used in the following situations:

when there is evidence of negligence or mismanagement
  when there is an environmental impact
  to remove an identifiable financial gain or saving as a result of the breach
  where it is not in the public interest to prosecute
What happens to the money once the VMP has been paid?

The money is transferred to Her Majesty’s Treasury – the Environment Agency does not keep the money to fund its own activities or have a say in how the money is used.  The Environment Agency is however, able to recover its costs, using an Enforcement Cost Recovery Notice.

30/08/2017,The CCS G-Cloud framework helps save DWP an estimated £20 million per year.,"
    
          
The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) introduced the ‘Tell Us Once’ system back in 2011 to make it easier for people to inform the government about a change in their personal circumstances.

Using ‘Tell Us Once’, departments and agencies like Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the Passport Office and local authorities are informed about a person’s change in circumstances in parallel, removing the need for repeated, unnecessary form-filling.

DWP was paying for physical hosting of the service through a single, non-extendable, managed contract.

Faced with the hard stop of the existing contract, the emerging Government Digital Agenda and the need to drive down costs, DWP needed a solution that would move from a physical hosted system to a commodity cloud-based solution.

A simple process with effective outcomes

Timescales were tight for DWP, who had only an 8-month delivery window.

The department had no in-house experience to conduct a physical to virtual cloud transition; so they took the decision to bring in external support through CCS’s G-Cloud framework, which is hosted on the Digital Marketplace.

By following the steps in the simple buying process - listing requirements, key word searches, reviewing service offerings and applying filters to reach a short list - DWP was able to to hold a supplier open day.

In just 8 weeks, digital technology specialists Kainos were awarded the contract.

Kainos guided the DWP project team through the transition to cloud. Having a really experienced transition manager was crucial to the success of the project.

A ‘lift and shift’ approach was taken to move from the current incumbent physical state to a virtual state hosted by UKCloud.

Kainos took advantage of the fact that the go-live date was scheduled for 29 August 2016 - a bank holiday everywhere except in Scotland. The company took the small amount of live data received on this day and carried out user assurance, rolling the system out to the rest of the UK subsequently.

Working through the bank holiday and utilising traditional ‘down days’, the supplier was able to test their solution before full roll-out.

The result

Cutting administration costs and reducing the overpayments of benefits - usually because of out-of-date records of people’s personal circumstances - protected the cross-government savings generated by Tell Us Once, estimated at more than £20 million per year.

By switching from a physical infrastructure to a cloud solution, DWP has also benefited from cost savings of around 50% on the IT running costs of Tell Us Once.

The solution is also scalable and flexible, giving assurance that the department will be ready to grow and change it as circumstances demand.

Why G-Cloud?

We asked DWP what they would suggest to other buyers to consider when looking for a similar requirement.

Fidelma Holland, Strategic Design, Planning and Quality Lead for Tell Us Once explains:

“Engage with the market before you draw up service requirements. Suppliers are happy to provide advice on what you need to think about in terms of scope of requirement and the offering.

“Be realistic with delivery timescales and budget. Suppliers know and understand the art of the possible.

“Be inclusive with the supplier. Get them to spend time with service ‘front end’ so they can appreciate the impact on end users of what they are transitioning.

“And work hard at the relationship. Make them feel part of your team, it will pay dividends.

“Using G-Cloud was crucial in ensuring we got what we wanted in a very short timescale.”

Russell Sloan, Head of Digital Services at Kainos said:

“Cloud adoption is key to achieving significant savings in the running costs of important services like Tell Us Once as well as providing the flexibility and security to continue leveraging this, and other services, in the future.

“Following an efficient G-Cloud procurement, Kainos was delighted to be selected to work collaboratively with DWP on this project and again deliver on schedule, with a highly successful outcome being realised by DWP.”

07/04/2022,The CMA has appointed Sorcha O’Carroll as its new Senior Director of Mergers.,"
    
          Sorcha has worked as a Director of Mergers at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) since 2019 and replaces Joel Bamford who left in February. Her appointment follows an open recruitment process that attracted applications from a strong field of candidates.

As Senior Director of Mergers, Sorcha will be the decision-maker on complex Phase 1 merger cases, as well as overseeing the merger team’s work across both Phase 1 and 2 inquiries. Following the UK’s exit from the EU, the CMA has taken on responsibility for merger cases that were previously reserved for the European Commission, which are typically larger and more complex.

Sorcha will work alongside Colin Raftery, who is also a Senior Director in the mergers team, and report to David Stewart, Executive Director for Markets and Mergers.

David Stewart, Executive Director for Markets and Mergers at the CMA, said:


  It’s a pleasure to welcome someone of Sorcha’s experience and acumen to the CMA’s senior leadership team. Everyone who works with Sorcha knows that she brings enormous strengths to our mergers work. Her analytical skill and strategic judgment will be vital in this critical role, as the CMA continues to build on its strong track record as a world-class competition authority.


On her appointment, Sorcha said:


  I’m delighted to accept this role at a time when the CMA is taking on more complex merger inquiries than ever before.

  Competition has an important role in delivering the best possible outcomes for people across the UK; this is especially important as the cost of living rises.

  I look forward to working closely with Colin, David and the rest of the CMA’s renowned mergers team as we investigate deals to ensure that they do not undermine competition and leave people worse off.


Sorcha took up her appointment on 1 April 2022. Before joining the CMA, she worked in private practice in the UK and Canada.

Notes to editors

This appointment was managed by a Civil Service Commissioner to ensure a fair, merit-based, and open process, in keeping with the Civil Service Recruitment Principles.
  The role was advertised publicly with applicants being asked to submit an application form and cover letter detailing their suitability for the role, as measured against a published role profile with a set of required skills and experience.

26/01/2022,"The CMA has secured improvements for Xbox online players, following concerns about Microsoft’s use of auto-renewing subscriptions for online gaming services.","
    
          The changes relate to Microsoft’s practices in relation to the automatic renewal of contracts for online gaming services. Microsoft’s Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass products allow people to access a library of games and play together online. They are offered as memberships which are often entered into on an auto-renewal basis. This means that membership is automatically rolled over at the end of each contract period and the customer charged unless they actively take steps to stop the subscription.

As part of an investigation into the online console video gaming sector the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) identified concerns about certain features of Microsoft’s auto-renewing subscriptions, in particular: whether it was clear upfront that contracts would automatically renew; how easy it was to turn off automatic renewal; and whether people may not have realised they were still paying for services they no longer used.

The CMA has secured undertakings with Microsoft which are designed to address these concerns. The improvements include:


    Better upfront information: Microsoft will provide more transparent, upfront information to help customers understand their Xbox membership – making clear, for example, that the subscription will auto-renew unless the customer turns off auto-renewal; when the subscription will auto-renew; how much it will cost; and how the customer can receive a refund after an accidental renewal
  
  
    Refunds: Microsoft will contact existing customers on recurring 12-month contracts and give them the option to end their contract and claim a pro-rata refund
  
  
    Inactive memberships: Microsoft will also contact existing customers who haven’t used their memberships for a long time but are still paying. These customers will be reminded how to stop payments, and if they continue not to use their memberships, Microsoft will ultimately stop taking further payments
  
  
    Better information about price increases: Microsoft will give clearer notifications of any future price rises, and will ensure people know how to turn off auto-renewal if they don’t want to pay the higher price
  
Michael Grenfell, Executive Director of Enforcement at the CMA, said:


  Gamers need to be given clear and timely information to make informed choices when signing up for auto-renewing memberships and subscriptions. We are therefore pleased that Microsoft has given the CMA these formal undertakings to improve the fairness of their practices and protect consumers, and will be offering refunds to certain customers.

  Other companies offering memberships and subscriptions that auto-renew should take note, and review their practices to ensure they comply with consumer protection law.



Full details of the undertakings are available on the CMA’s website.

Notes to editors

For media enquiries, contact the CMA press office on 020 3738 6460 or press@cma.gov.uk.
  Microsoft, as referred above, consists of Microsoft Limited and Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited.
  The undertakings apply to contracts between Microsoft and consumers for the supply of Xbox Live Gold, Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate (or any online video gaming product which replaces, rebrands or includes these products) which are associated with a console and subject to auto-renewal.
  For the avoidance of doubt, the offering of these undertakings is not an admission that any person or firm has breached the law. Only a court can decide whether a breach has occurred.
  An undertaking is a voluntary agreement a firm makes to address an enforcement authority’s concerns and resolve an investigation without the need for court action.
  The key pieces of consumer protection legislation relevant to the CMA’s investigation are: the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs); Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA); and the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (CCRs). The CPRs contain a general prohibition against unfair commercial practices and specific prohibitions against misleading actions, misleading omissions and aggressive commercial practices. Part 2 of the CRA aims to protect consumers against unfair contract terms and notices, and requires contract terms to be fair and transparent. The CCRs regulate the information that should be provided to consumers before they make a purchase, cancellation rights for certain contracts and the use of pre-ticked boxes for additional payments.

19/07/2011,Solar powered technology funded by UK aid brings light to rural Pakistan,"
    
          
A bright idea

Marvi may not look like an early adopter of the latest technology but, thanks to UK aid, she is reaping the benefits of a very practical gadget - a multi-purpose solar light. 

“I use the solar light for cooking at night,” she explains. “We save money because we had to buy candles and kerosene before. We also use it to charge our mobile phones.”

Power to the people

Yousaf Babar village in rural Sindh province, where Marvi and her 7 children live, has had no electricity since the floods last year, and the villagers have had to spend what little money they had on candles, kerosene oil, and rechargeable torches, instead of food.

As part of the UK’s response to the floods, DFID has provided 12,000 innovative solar light units to people in Yousaf Babar and other villages across southern Pakistan. This is the first time DFID has invested in solar technology as part of the UK’s response to a disaster.

The solar lights cost about £10 per unit and give sustainable, free light for up to 10 hours after each charge, and can last for up to 5 years. The cost is recouped within a couple of months, providing excellent value for money.

Into the light

People who lost their homes after the devastating floods in Pakistan last year had to live in emergency camps and tent cities for months. These camps had no light, and research has shown that abuse on women and children always tends to increase, due in part to no light being available when they go to the toilet after dark. Providing simple solar powered lighting can help tackle this.

Staying in touch

Another benefit to the solar technology is recharging mobile phones, which are vital communication lifelines in rural areas. Landline telephones do not exist in much of rural Pakistan, or were destroyed in the floods, so mobile phones are essential for allowing people forced away from their homes to keep in touch with family and community. The solar light technology provided by UK aid can be adapted to charge people’s mobile phones, helping reunite displaced families and communities, and help people to try to get back to a normal life.

This will offer £10 million of additional housing support, bringing the total projected government spend on housing support to £30 billion this year.

Increases to the Shared Accommodation Rate (SAR) are expected to benefit thousands of Universal Credit and Housing Benefit claimants, and have been introduced more than two years earlier than the original implementation date of October 2023.

The SAR is applied to renters aged under 35 claiming support through Local Housing Allowance (LHA). It adjusts their benefit to the cost of renting a room in shared accommodation, but there is a higher, one-bedroom rate for people who need to rent solo housing.

Changes to the Local Housing Association rate
There are two key changes:

Care leavers can now claim the higher one-bedroom LHA rate for longer, as the maximum age limit has been raised to 25, from 22.
  Anyone who has lived in a homeless hostel for 3 months or more, regardless of age, will also now be able to claim the higher rate, as the age limit has been removed.
For example, in Harlow and Stortford a single care leaver aged 23 could expect to receive up to £387 additional housing support per month as a result of the change.

Minister for Welfare Delivery Will Quince said:


  These changes are an immediate boost for some of the most vulnerable young people in our communities.



  We know that having a safe, secure home is vital to getting on your feet and often into work. By bringing these changes in early, we’re able to help more people right now, as we all look to recover from the pandemic.

18/07/2020,The government is set to publish its landmark Bill to deliver the biggest changes to building safety for nearly 40 years and make residents safer in their homes.,"
    
          

New laws to bring biggest improvements to building safety for a generation
  Regulator to raise standards, enforce new laws and give louder voice to residents so building owners ensure their safety
  Fire safety consultation seeks views on proposals to implement recommendations from Grenfell Tower Inquiry and strengthen Fire Safety Order


The government is set to publish its landmark Bill to deliver the biggest changes to building safety for nearly 40 years and make residents safer in their homes.

The Building Safety Bill, to be published in draft form on Monday (20 July 2020), will improve regulations as the government seeks to bring forward a clearer system with residents’ safety at the heart of it.

Residents have helped to develop the proposals through engagement groups, and under the new rules, people living in high rise buildings will be empowered to challenge inaction from their building owner and have better access to safety information about their building and will benefit from a swift and effective complaints process.

A Building Safety Regulator, already being set up within the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), will be fully established and equipped with the power to hold building owners to account or face the consequences. 

It will enforce a new, more stringent set of rules that will apply for buildings of 18 metres or more or taller than 6 storeys from the design phase to occupation.

The government views the draft Bill as legislation that will evolve as further evidence and risks are identified to ensure that residents’ safety is always prioritised and will also provide new powers to better regulate construction materials and products to ensure they are safe to use.

Government expert Michael Wade has been asked to work with leaseholders, and the finance and insurance industries. He will test and recommend funding solutions to protect leaseholders from unaffordable costs of fixing historic defects, ensuring that the burden does not fall on tax payers. He will also develop proposals to address insurance issues around building safety.

The draft Bill includes a new ‘building safety charge’ to give leaseholders greater transparency around costs incurred in maintaining a safe building – with numerous powers deliberately included to limit the costs that can be re-charged to leaseholders.

It comes as the government will also publish a consultation on Monday, which sets out proposals to implement the recommendations from Phase 1 of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry that require a change in law.

The consultation will also look at strengthening fire safety in all regulated buildings in England to ensure that people are safe from fire regardless of where they live, stay or work. Taken with the draft Bill, these measures will improve the safety of residents in buildings of all heights.

Housing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  This is a significant milestone on our journey to fundamentally improving building safety and delivering real change that will keep people safer in their homes.

  I remain committed to making sure we get this right, which is why I will be publishing the draft Bill for scrutiny and improvement before it is introduced in Parliament.

  I am also calling on the industry to actively prepare for these changes now. It is vital that the sector moves in step with us, to provide confidence and reassurance to residents that their safety is firmly at the heart of everything we do.


Building Safety and Fire Minister Lord Greenhalgh said:


  As a government we are determined to learn the lessons from that fateful night at Grenfell Tower and ensure that a tragedy like this does not happen again.

  These are the biggest changes to building safety legislation for nearly 40 years, and they will raise standards across the industry and ensure building owners have nowhere to hide if they break the rules.

  Consulting on key recommendations from the Inquiry and wider changes to fire safety regulation will give those affected the opportunity to make their voices heard and help us implement lasting, significant change.


Independent advisor and author of the Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety, Dame Judith Hackitt said:


  I welcome this draft Bill as an important milestone in delivering the fundamental reform this industry needs to make residents and buildings safer.

  It meets the ambitions and recommendations set out in my review.

  And industry must be in no doubt that it is not enough to wait for the Bill to become law before they implement changes; we expect them to start taking action now.


The government is also announcing that full applications for the £1 billion Building Safety Fund, to remove unsafe non-ACM cladding from buildings, can be submitted from 31 July – with 747 registration forms processed since 1 June. 

To also ensure that building owners are clear on which steps they need to take to ensure the building is safe, we will also publish a new Manual to the Building Regulations which contains all Approved Documents in one place.

21/05/2021,Charities and companies which help rehabilitate offenders have been awarded around £200 million of Government funding to help cut crime in the new probation system.,"
    
          

Services to provide specialist housing, employment and training support to reduce reoffending
  Multi-million-pound contracts awarded to more than 25 organisations
  Providers to work with Probation Service to rehabilitate offenders and cut crime


The investment of an initial £195 million has been awarded to 26 organisations across England and Wales to provide vital support services that help reduce reoffending, such as employment and housing advice. This includes over £45 million awarded to services tailored to female offenders to address their specific needs and the underlying causes of their crimes as part of the Government’s pledge to see fewer women go to prison. The total funding awarded could rise to £270 million if contracts with these organisations are extended to their full terms.

By tackling the drivers of crime and getting offenders’ lives back on track, these services will help to prevent thousands of people becoming victims each year and save some of the £18 billion annual cost of repeat offending.

The move is one of the improvements being made to the Probation Service next month as responsibility for supervising low- and medium-risk offenders comes back under public sector control.  The delivery of unpaid work in community sentences and behavioural change programmes are also being brought back in-house.

Prisons and Probation Minister Alex Chalk said:


  Tackling things like homelessness, unemployment and illiteracy is vital to our drive to cut crime but these issues cannot be solved by our brilliant probation staff alone.



  The expertise and support of charities and companies like those we are funding today plays a crucial role in helping offenders to rehabilitate and lead a crime-free life.


Almost £46 million has been awarded to charities which provide wraparound support to women in the criminal justice system, acknowledging the complex array of issues female offenders particularly face. Organisations including The Nelson Trust, Women in Prison, and a partnership between the St Giles Trust and the Wise Group will work with vulnerable women to help them get their lives back on track. This significant investment provides long-term support to women’s centres and other dedicated services for women serving community sentences or leaving prison.

Prison leavers are around 50 per cent more likely to reoffend if released with nowhere to stay so over £33 million will be shared by charities helping the homeless, including St Mungo’s, Shelter and NACRO. Their work will help get offenders off the streets into stable accommodation and work alongside the Probation Service’s new temporary accommodation service.

A further £33 million has been awarded to companies such as Seetec, Maximus and Ingeus which provide offenders with skills training and employment support. With their expertise in helping people find work they will partner with probation staff and the New Futures Network in the Prison Service to support offenders into jobs.

Up to £118 million has been awarded to organisations which work with offenders to address personal issues, including Catch 22, The Forward Trust and The Growth Company. This ranges from support accessing mental health services to help with managing complex family relationships.

The funding has been awarded through a new process designed to make it easier for charities and other third-sector organisations to access funding from Government and around two-thirds of the funding has been awarded to registered charities. In addition, many lead organisations are using the specialist skills of smaller organisations to help deliver services, with another 50 organisations, mostly in the voluntary sector, in their supply chains.

Notes to Editors

Women’s and personal support services have been procured at Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) level, while each provider for Education, Training and Employment services will work across one of the twelve probation regions in England and Wales. Accommodation services will also be provided at a regional level except in Wales where they have been procured at PCC level.
  For the first time, the Probation Service is jointly commissioning the full range of rehabilitative services in Greater Manchester with the region’s Combined Authority from July 2021. In London, women’s services will be commissioned jointly with the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) by providing funding to MOPAC’s existing providers for an extension and expansion of the current service. A new commissioning process will be undertaken for services from 2022.
Full list of contracts awarded according to region

Please note, the figures given are for the standard term of the contracts which are 2 years and 9 months, unless specified (see each contract below). Note Women’s services contracts are for 3 years and 9 months. For Accommodation and Education, Training and Employment services these are predicted values.

03/12/2020,The Environment Agency’s modern and free Flood Warning Service has proved so effective that sirens in Grimsby and Cleethorpes are to be decommissioned.,"
    
          More than 80% of the 33,000 properties at risk of flooding in the area now receive advanced warnings through the direct-messaging service, making the old sirens redundant.

The towns’ 18 flood sirens were installed in 2006 to help warn the vast majority of at-risk properties that – at the time – were not yet signed up to the then-fledgling Flood Warning Service.

Sirens now redundant

Now, 14 years later, that service’s advanced-warning messages are delivered to around 3,750 more properties than the sirens were ever able to reach, with more accurate, tailored and reliable messages than the sirens could.

Using the latest forecasting and modelling techniques, the Flood Warning Service alerts people to the possibility of flooding many hours – and sometimes days – in advance.

It sends timely, tailored, location-specific messages with exact details of what to expect, when, and how to react.

Sign up to stay alert

Those messages can be sent via a choice of text, landline, mobile and email – or any combination of those methods up to a maximum selection of five. For example, text messages to two mobiles, emails to two addresses, and an automated call to a landline.

It is a far cry from a short-notice, potentially confusing siren containing no specifics and no advice, and with no guarantee of being heard.

Since the Flood Warning Service launched in 2006, the Environment Agency and its partners have been continuously transforming it, making the best use of the latest technology to better reach people living, working and travelling through flood-risk areas.

World-class warning service

Innovations include automated warning messages to mobile phones registered with certain providers, and becoming one of the first European countries to use Google Public Alerts to display live flood warnings on Google searches and Google Maps, just seconds after they have been issued.

The advances combine to make England’s Flood Warning Service among the best in the world – and the sirens out-dated.

Ben Thornely, flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, said:


  We know how devastating flooding can be, and we want people to have the most accurate and timely information when flooding is expected.

  The best way of doing that is via our free, reliable Flood Warning Service, which gives people clear, specific advice on how to protect themselves, their loved ones and their homes. This just isn’t possible with sirens.

  It takes just a minute to check online if you’re at risk of flooding and to sign up for warnings. We urge people to do that now via GOV.UK/Flood or by calling 0345 988 1188.

  Doing so can reduce the impact of flooding – saving you thousands of pounds.


Cllr Stewart Swinburn, North East Lincolnshire Council’s cabinet member for the environment, said:


  We’ve been kept up-to-date with the Environment Agency’s plans for the flood sirens and they’ve also held two virtual sessions with councillors to explain their proposals. Those sessions have allowed us to inform the Environment Agency’s approach and we’ve stressed the need for local people to be given all the information they require to adapt to the changes with the sirens.

  We’re aware similar system updates have worked well in other areas and we share the Environment Agency’s expectation that advances in technology will make it easier for people to get any flood messages as quickly as possible should the need arise.


To give the best service, the Flood Warning Service relies on people choosing to sign up. It takes around a minute to do so, and can help reduce flooding’s impact and damage – saving potentially thousands of pounds.


People are urged to sign up now via 0345 988 1188 or GOV.UK/Flood, where there is also information on the practical things people can do to protect their businesses, homes and valuables.


Prepare for flooding

Checking if you live in an area at high risk of flooding, preparing a bag with medication and important documents, and moving valuable and sentimental items upstairs or to a safe place can reduce the damage caused by a flood by around 40%.

Since the sirens were installed in 2006, the Environment Agency has invested around £20m into the area’s flood defences. That includes a £19m upgrade along the Humber and at the port of Grimsby, and improvements along the River Freshney. Further work between Immingham and Grimsby is expected to begin in 2022.

The Environment Agency plans to stop using the flood sirens from 31 December 2020.

Background

The Flood Warning Service currently reaches 83% of at-risk properties in the area, compared to the 72% of at-risk properties within audible range of a siren. Even those in range of a siren may not hear them because of things like wind direction and double glazing.
  The average cost of repairing a flood-damaged home is around £32,000.
  33,235 homes are at risk of flooding across the area. - 27,735 (around 83%) are reached by the Flood Warning Service. 5,500 (around 17%) are not reached by the Flood Warning Service and need to sign up. 23,997 (72%) are in range of a siren but not guaranteed to hear it or know how to react.
  5.2 million properties are at risk of flooding in England. People are urged to visit GOV.UK/Flood, check if they’re at risk, and make sure they know what to do if it floods.
  In many flood risk areas, people can sign up for flood warnings. These warn of the risk of flooding from rivers, the sea and groundwater. They’ll alert people by phone, email or text when flooding is expected.
  The best way for people to protect themselves from flooding is to know what to do in advance – they can download and save a simple Prepare, Act, Survive plan so they know what to do when there’s a flood warning in their area.
  The National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy was adopted in Autumn 2020 and sets the blueprint for how the Environment Agency and other organisations will manage flood and coastal change from now until 2100.

10/12/2020,New scheme to help adults across England facing multiple disadvantages like homelessness and mental health issues.,"
    
          

New scheme to help adults across England facing multiple disadvantages like homelessness and mental health issues
  Local partnerships will provide joined-up support for better outcomes
  Lessons learned from ‘Changing Futures’ scheme will inform national policy


A £46 million scheme to provide more effective and coordinated support for some of the most vulnerable people in our communities was launched today (10 December 2020) by Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing Kelly Tolhurst.

The government is inviting local organisations to form partnerships and bid for a share of the funding to better support those who experience multiple disadvantages including homelessness, substance misuse, mental health issues, domestic abuse, and contact with the criminal justice system.

These people are among the most vulnerable in our communities, facing entrenched disadvantage and trauma. They often experience difficulties in getting the coordinated support from local services that they need.

This can lead to increased reoffending, greater risk of rough sleeping and ill-health and can result in a higher demand and costs for local response services and the criminal justice system.

The ‘Changing Futures’ programme aims to establish new, innovative and co-ordinated ways to better support vulnerable adults. The prospectus, published today, invites expressions of interest from organisations such as councils, health bodies, police, probation services, voluntary and community sector organisations to form local partnerships.

Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Kelly Tolhurst said:


  This £46 million funding will help some of the most vulnerable people in our communities turn their lives around and build a brighter future.

  The ‘Changing Futures’ programme gives local organisations the flexibility and resources they need to work in partnership to deliver effective support where it is needed most. I look forward to receiving really innovative bids for projects that will make a real difference to so many people’s lives


The Programme, announced at the Budget, aims to deliver improvements at the individual, service and system level:

for individuals, to stabilise and then improve the life situation of adults who face multiple disadvantage
  for services, to better integrate local services to provide a person-centred approach and to reduce demand on reactive services
  for the local system, to test a different approach to funding, accountability and engagement between local commissioners and services, and central government and local areas
The programme will run alongside evaluation, applying learning from local areas to national policymaking, aiming to deliver better outcomes with taxpayers’ money.

12/05/2021,Renters will continue to be supported as national COVID-19 restrictions ease.,"
    
          


    Four-month notice periods for most tenants until at least end of September
  
  
    Move will ensure renters are protected as we continue through the Roadmap
  


Renters will continue to be supported as national COVID-19 restrictions ease, with longer notice periods in place until at least October, Housing Minister Christopher Pincher announced today (12 May 2021).

Thanks to the success of the vaccine programme and the public efforts to suppress the virus, the nation is now progressing cautiously through the Roadmap, and emergency measures for renters introduced during the pandemic will be brought in line with this.

As part of a phased approach, notice periods – previously extended to 6 months as an emergency measure during the pandemic – will be set at 4 months from 1 June. This will offer tenants continued protection throughout Step 3 and into Step 4, which will begin from 21 June at the earliest.

Subject to the public health advice and progress with the Roadmap, notice periods will return to pre-pandemic levels from 1 October.

The current ban on bailiff-enforced evictions, introduced as an emergency measure during lockdown, will end on 31 May. Bailiffs have been asked not to carry out an eviction if anyone living in the property has COVID-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.

The measures will ensure renters continue to be protected with longer notice periods for the coming months, while allowing landlords to access justice – 45% of private landlords own just one property and are highly vulnerable to rent arrears.

Extensive financial support remains in place to help people meet their outgoings, including the furlough scheme and the Universal Credit uplift, which have both been extended until the end of September.

Housing Minister, Rt Hon Christopher Pincher MP said:


  From the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken unprecedented action to protect renters and help keep them in their homes.

  As COVID restrictions are eased in line with the Roadmap out of lockdown, we will ensure tenants continue to be supported with longer notice periods, while also balancing the need for landlords to access justice.

  Crucial financial support also remains in place including the furlough scheme and uplift to Universal Credit.


Courts will continue to prioritise the most serious cases, such as those involving fraud or anti-social behaviour, with many of the evictions waiting to be enforced when the ban lifts predating the pandemic.

This week the government announced that a white paper will be published in the autumn that will set out proposals to create a fairer private rented sector that works for both landlords and tenants.

This includes proposals for the abolition of Section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions to give tenants greater security and a new ‘lifetime deposit’ to ease the burden when moving house.

When Warm Wales CEO Phil Roberts talks about the work his Community Interest Company does, something most of us take for granted – a heated home – has a whole new level of meaning. “It’s hard to believe but we’ve found children performing badly at school because they’re doing their homework in the living room in competition with the television,” he says, “because that’s the only warm room in the house.” 
Warm Wales has simple aims: to make sure homes in Wales have affordable warmth, while reducing the national carbon footprint. It does this by helping people connect to mains gas or renewable heating, insulate their homes and access any entitlements they might be missing. “We target vulnerable homes where budgets are tight and the rising cost of fuel increases the strain” says Phil.

Through its work, Warm Wales has a positive impact on the environment. At the same time, it needs to make sure that any technologies introduced are affordable. Warm Wales helps social landlords to meet their obligations towards improving housing stock and assists energy suppliers to meet their regulatory requirements to save carbon by improving energy efficiency. Warm Wales brings together those with the funding to invest and those with the expenses to meet, to deliver cost effective programmes of work using professional, technical and project management skills. As a result, recipients can heat their homes properly, meaning less illness, fewer and shorter hospital visits, better educational attainment and more employment. Warm Wales uses its business surpluses to discount costs and offer additional services to those who fall outside the net of conventional funding schemes.

Having established a reputation for bringing investment into Wales and successful delivery of large scale programmes, Warm Wales has gone on to manage schemes of work under the Welsh Government’s ARBED (Save) programme.

“We are proud of the way in which we fulfilled the programme remit to deliver a wide range of energy saving home improvements for communities and provide training and employment for local people,” says Phil, “In the future we intend to expand and build our quality services to provide our clients with excellent value and our communities with tangible benefits.”

Phil says that the company operates in a businesslike manner and decided against Charity status. “As a CIC we can build strong strategic partnerships, especially with local authorities because they know that we are regulated by the CIC regulator and work on an open book basis. Surpluses go into an asset lock and they can see exactly what happens to them and that they are reinvested into helping more and more people in their communities.”

01/11/2019,"Funding will be available to partner organisations, including charities, from April 2020 to help vulnerable people claim Universal Credit.","
    
          Secretary of State Therese Coffey has today (1 November 2019) announced a £10 million Universal Credit Transition Fund for outreach programmes to help vulnerable people make Universal Credit claims.

The fund will be available to partner organisations across the UK, including charities, from April 2020. It will aim to help vulnerable people, including disabled people, care leavers and those with mental health issues, claim Universal Credit as a route into work. It will support innovative ideas for engaging with vulnerable people early, helping them to make timely claims to the new benefit.

Figures show that a fifth of claimants delayed making a claim for Universal Credit, largely because they didn’t know how to make a claim or because they thought they would find a job quickly.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Dr Therese Coffey MP said:


  I am delighted to announce a £10 million challenge fund to support the most vulnerable in society with their Universal Credit claims.

  Universal Credit is now supporting more than 2.5 million people. Around 1 million disabled households are better off under Universal Credit and we will continue to deliver targeted support through this fund and other measures.


The £10 million funding was allocated to DWP as part of the 2019 Spending Round process.

Other help for vulnerable people

DWP is providing severe disability payments (SDP) to protect the most vulnerable. Severely disabled claimants can receive SDP to support their living costs as they move onto Universal Credit. This is worth a maximum of £405 a month to claimants – worth £600 million over the next 6 years for 45,000 claimants.

Around 1 million disabled households will receive an average of around £100 more per month through Universal Credit.

20/08/2020,"From today (20 August), local land charges search results will be easier to read as they will no longer reveal adjoining registration details.","
    
          The enhancement to our Local Land Charges (LLC) service is part of a series of changes we are making to improve the customer experience.

Local land charges searches are normally required in the property-buying process. Most local land charges are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of a property, such as planning permissions or listed buildings. A search will reveal whether a property is subject to a charge.

Some customers had commented that search results were overly complicated and revealed too much information. We are continually listening to customer feedback and looking for ways to improve the LLC service. Based on these comments, this service change will improve the user experience by making search results simpler and more accessible.

Mark Edwards, LLC Service Manager


  We have learned so much more from customers and users about how they use HM Land Registry’s Local Land Charges service and what works for them. Following their feedback, the introduction of these changes mean that we can provide a better customer service and reduce some of the work required by users to interpret LLC data. We are engaging with our user groups and are always looking to improve our service design to create the best service possible.


Andrew Prismall, Chairman of the Association of Independent Personal Search Agents (IPSA)


  We are pleased to see that HM Land Registry is acting on feedback to improve its LLC service. When I proposed and recommended these changes to the IPSA membership, they were unanimously approved. Through providing feedback and working with our members, IPSA is proud to continue to collaborate with HM Land Registry to ensure the evolution of the LLC service.


We are continuing to work in partnership local authorities in England to migrate their LLC data to our central, digital register. Once migrated, anyone can get instant online search results for that area using the Search for local land charges service.

The benefits of having immediate access to local land charges search results are greatly appreciated by customers. The average time to complete a search has reduced from 39 days to a few minutes and the cost of an official search will be reduced from the highest fee of £85 to £15. The next local authority to go live on the LLC Register will be Milton Keynes Council on Thursday 27 August .

22/10/2019,A new report published today by the Social Security Advisory Committee highlights steps needed to improve the welfare of separated parents and their children.,"
    
          A report published today by the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) calls on the government to do more to ensure that after parents separate, the social security and child maintenance systems supports the welfare of both parents and their children.

There are 2.5 million separated families, including 3.9 million children, in Great Britain. Separation is often an extremely difficult and challenging life event, which carries an increased risk of negative outcomes and poorer life chances for children and parents involved. The report considers the experience of separated parents and their children in the social security and child maintenance systems. It particularly looks at the experience of parents who are not the main carers, but who want a continuing parental role – a group who are often overlooked. Overall, it recognises the difficult public policy choices faced by governments but asks whether separated parents are getting the support they need through a challenging and stressful time in their lives.

The report finds that many separated parents share caring responsibilities for their children. However, those who need to claim social security can struggle to share care because the system assumes there is one main carer and so only one parent can be entitled to child-related benefits. The other parent can only receive single adult benefits which do not factor in the inevitable costs of caring for children even if parents are sharing care.

In particular, young non-resident parents may struggle to share care, as housing support in the private-rented sector typically only covers a room for an adult in shared accommodation. This can make it difficult, or impossible in some cases, for a parent to have their child or children to stay overnight.

Much of the existing research has understandably focused on the parent with whom the children live most of the time and highlights the severe negative impact that separation can have on their financial well-being. However, children may also experience hardship if and when they are with their other parent and emerging evidence suggests that paying child maintenance can push parents into poverty.

Research found that separated parents without main responsibility of childcare have a poverty rate of 30% compared to 21% amongst working age adults.

The report concludes that a lack of clear, consistent and helpful publicly available advice makes it hard for separated parents to navigate what is a complex social security system and so adds to their stress during separation. Sometimes parents feel they have been very poorly treated by the Child Maintenance Service, with poor communication resulting in confusion and unnecessarily long delays to child maintenance arrangements being set up.

Liz Sayce, the Committee’s interim chair, said:


  Social security needs to enable children, and families, to thrive whether or not parents have separated. We urge the government to develop a clear strategy for supporting separated parents in the social security system. While there is a general policy focus on children’s welfare, the government does not appear to be considering separated parents and their children’s welfare as a joined-up issue.

  We recognise that there are no easy policy solutions. Nevertheless, we believe that improvements are needed to ensure separated parents, both those with main and without main responsibility of care, are not unduly suffering. This is vital to ensure no negative impact on the welfare of their children.


The committee recommends that:


    The government clearly and publicly articulates a strategy for separated parents (including parents without main caring responsibility) and their children with respect to the social security system. We recommend that a cross-departmental working group is set up to lead urgent action on the strategy and issues highlighted in this report.
  
  
    The quality and availability of data on parents without the main responsibility of care should be improved to get a better understanding of the scale and nature of the problems created by the social security system and its interaction with the child maintenance system. These data should also help define evidence-based policy solutions to deliver the government’s strategy and allow progress against the strategy to be assessed and monitored objectively.
  
  
    We are not making general recommendations to change benefit rules because we believe that better data and a clear overarching strategy are needed first. However, there are obvious challenges for separated parents to share care under current policy for housing support in the social security system. Therefore, we recommend that:

    a) The housing element of Universal Credit should enable young parents, under 35 years, who are sharing care and paying child maintenance, to have their children to stay overnight.

    b) Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) should consider options for the system to support all parents without the main responsibility of care and with more than one child to stay with them overnight.
  
We would also encourage DWP to consider ways to improve the child maintenance formula. For example, review the earnings thresholds, which have not been updated since 1998, to ensure they factor in the well-being and living standards of both parents and their children.

24/03/2020,The CMA has completed a research project to examine competition and regulation in the Scottish legal services sector.,"
    
          The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is recommending a series of measures to improve the information made available to people to make it easier for them to shop around when arranging their house purchase or dealing with a divorce. The CMA is also recommending a series of regulatory reforms, including that an independent body regulates legal services in Scotland.

Well-functioning legal services are critical to people and businesses, who can face costly legal needs at important moments in their lives. However, there are indications that the Scottish legal services sector may not currently be delivering good outcomes for people. Consumer complaints are increasing; high street solicitors are facing challenging market conditions; and regulation in Scotland has not adequately responded to new market pressures.

While there have been longstanding discussions in Scotland about the need for regulatory reform and lifting restrictions in the legal services sector, the pace of reform has been slow.

The  CMA examined how well the current sector is functioning. It studied whether there is evidence of a lack of competition among legal service providers in Scotland, looking specifically at the transparency of information on price and quality. This work built on the CMA’s previous market study into legal services in England and Wales. The CMA carried out a survey, asking all the legal service firms in Scotland that provide the services most demanded by Scottish consumers for their views on offering better information on prices to their clients.

The CMA considers that legal providers can and should do a better job of informing people on what the costs will be.

To help customers get better value for money and make sure the industry is best placed to be competitive, the CMA is making a number of recommendations including:

A review by the Law Society of Scotland of the impact of existing price and service transparency guidance, including whether mandatory rules could strengthen the information available.
  Asking the Law Society of Scotland and the Scottish Government to implement the alternative business structures scheme and for the Scottish government to remove certain restrictive requirements of the scheme. Legislation was passed to enable this in 2010 and it is well overdue. This will help law firms to be more flexible and innovative so that they can better adapt to consumer needs.
  The introduction of an independent body to regulate the legal profession, setting standards and handling complaints, as recommended by Esther Roberton. Evidence the CMA has seen and heard suggests that this is necessary. Separating regulation from representation will increase trust in this sector and result in better regulation.
The CMA encourages the Scottish Government to implement the recommendations promptly, but recognises the challenges of the current environment and the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak.

As part of its research, the CMA engaged with a wide range of organisations including the legal services regulators in Scotland, legal professionals and consumer bodies. The CMA also commissioned IFF Research to conduct a survey of solicitor firms in Scotland on its behalf last year.

Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s CEO said:


  It is important that people in Scotland have access to high-quality and good value legal services. In addition to increasing transparency of information, our recommendations are intended to introduce greater liberalisation that could foster growth and innovation in the delivery of legal services which would help the sector grow.

  You might not need a lawyer very often but when you do it will often be at a crucial point in your life, so addressing regulatory and competition shortcomings will make a real difference.

08/09/2022,The CMA’s initial investigation into Morrisons’ completed purchase of McColl’s shops has found competition concerns in 35 local areas where the 2 brands compete.,"
    
          However, overall, the deal would not harm the vast majority of shoppers or other businesses.

On 13 July 2022, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched its investigation after the companies submitted the reported £190 million deal for review.

McColl’s operates convenience newsagent shops, with over 1,100 stores across England, Scotland, and Wales, while Morrisons (owned by parent company Clayton, Dubilier & Rice ‘CD&R’) has around 500 grocery stores in the UK. CD&R is also the parent company of the Motor Fuel Group (MFG). MFG owns over 800 convenience stores, the vast majority of which are attached to its petrol stations.

Following its Phase 1 investigation, the CMA has found that the merger between Morrisons and McColl’s raises competition concerns in 35 areas, where McColl’s or MFG convenience stores will face reduced competition if the deal is allowed to go ahead as planned. Weaker competition could lead to higher prices or a lower quality service for the customers in these areas who rely on their local shops for groceries.

During the investigation, the retailers accepted that the merger would raise concerns in some areas and asked the CMA to move straight to a discussion of remedies to address these concerns.

Morrisons now has 5 working days to offer proposals to the CMA to address the competition concerns identified. The CMA would then have a further 5 working days to consider whether to accept these in principle instead of referring the case to a Phase 2 investigation.

Sorcha O’Carroll, CMA Senior Director of Mergers, said:


  As the cost of living soars, it’s particularly important that shops are facing proper competition so that customers get the best prices possible when picking up essentials or doing the weekly shop.

  While the vast majority of shoppers and other businesses won’t lose out, we’re concerned that the deal could lead to higher prices for people in some areas. If Morrisons and McColl’s can address these concerns, then we won’t need to move on to an in-depth investigation.

  In the meantime, we’re working closely with Morrisons to ensure that it can provide the support that McColl’s needs to continue to operate during our investigation.

08/11/2022,The purchase of student accommodation provider Student Roost by GIC and Greystar could lead to higher rent and lower quality housing for students in Birmingham.,"
    
          The Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) phase 1 assessment looked at how the proposed deal could impact students and universities across the UK, focusing on cities where GIC, Greystar and Student Roost have a significant combined presence.

The CMA found the acquisition would not lead to competition concerns in most cities because the combined businesses would continue to face sufficient competition from other accommodation providers. But in Birmingham, the CMA found that the combined businesses would not face enough competition across several university campuses, potentially resulting in higher prices and lower quality services for students.

GIC, Greystar and Student Roost have accepted the acquisition could raise competition concerns in Birmingham and intend to offer remedies to fully address them. The CMA expects to receive their formal proposal within the next 5 working days. Provided the proposed remedy addresses the CMA’s concerns, the merger will be cleared without the need for an in-depth phase 2 investigation.

Colin Raftery, Senior Mergers Director at the CMA, said:


  Aside from fees, rent is the biggest expense students face, and the rising cost of living is putting even more pressure on student budgets.

  Many university towns and cities are already dealing with a student accommodation shortage, which is why it’s crucial that private providers like those involved in this deal are competing effectively.

  We’re concerned this deal could result in students in Birmingham seeing higher prices or lower quality services. GIC, Greystar, and Student Roost have accepted our concerns and have told us that they plan address them. A solution that fully resolves our concerns will avoid the need for a more in-depth investigation.

Notes to editors:

A detailed summary of the CMA’s decision is available on the case page. The full text of the decision setting out the CMA’s investigation and analysis will be published in due course.
  The CMA’s competition concerns relate to 15 university campuses in Birmingham.
  The parties have until 15 November to submit proposals to address the CMA’s competition concerns. The CMA would then have until 22 November to consider whether to accept these in principle or refer the deal for an in-depth phase 2 investigation.

25/05/2022,"More than 1,000 Ukrainian pensioners who recently arrived in Britain after fleeing the Russian invasion are already receiving financial support through Pension Credit, new figures show.","
    
          The figures follow emergency regulations laid by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in March 2022 which enabled Ukrainians to immediately access benefits and other support upon their arrival.

Minister for Pensions Guy Opperman said:


  Our priority is ensuring those arriving from Ukraine can find safety here and get the support they need.



  Pension Credit provides a vital financial boost which is why we’re helping new arrivals apply, with translation services available for phone applications.



  I urge those hosting elderly Ukrainians – and all those across the country with older relatives and friends – to check with them and see if they could be eligible for this extra financial assistance.


As well as help with daily living costs of up to £182.60 per week for single people and £278.70 for couples, Pension Credit also opens up access to other support, such as help with rent and council tax, heating bills, free NHS dental care and free TV licenses for the over-75s.

To be eligible for Pension Credit, people need to be over State Pension age and on a low income. More than 1.4 million pensioners across Great Britain currently receive Pension Credit and take-up is at its highest level since 2010.

The government recently launched a campaign to boost take-up of Pension Credit among UK pensioners. The campaign aims to increase take-up both by encouraging older people to claim and encouraging others to speak to their retired friends and loved ones about the support.

The easiest way for Ukrainian nationals to apply for Pension Credit is by phone and the department has made translation services available to help new arrivals with their applications. The Freephone number: 0800 99 1234, is available Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm.

DWP staff are also delivering additional face-to-face assistance to those who need it, including advice on benefit eligibility and support with online applications.

Immediate access to Pension Credit and other means-tested benefits is just one of the ways the UK is continuing to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Ukrainian people and those forced to flee the country following Russia’s barbaric invasion.
"
09/07/2022,"Parents who refuse to pay child maintenance could face curfews, as Ministers plan new powers for the Child Maintenance Service.","
    
          The change is being considered as part of fresh proposals that will get more of the money that is owed to the children of separated parents.

The Child Maintenance Service (CMS) collected or arranged £1 billion in child maintenance payments last year, operating as a crucial weapon in the battle against child poverty. Child support payments help lift around 140,000 children out of poverty each year.

Curfew orders would be another method of enforcement, alongside current powers which include passport and driving license confiscation and earnings deduction orders, to tackle parents who continually refuse to pay maintenance owed.

As an alternative sanction to prison, which is costly and prevents maintenance getting to children, curfews would act as a deterrent by restricting and disrupting non-compliant parents’ lifestyles, stopping them, for example, from going out for dinner, to the pub or going on holiday.

The curfews would be monitored by an electronic tag with an electronic monitoring service applying the tag, monitoring and making sure the parent complies with the rules of the tag. If parents fail to comply, the CMS would be able refer them back to court which might then extend the curfew order or impose a prison sentence.

DWP Lords Minister Baroness Stedman-Scott said:


  For children in low-income households, maintenance payments can make all the difference, lifting them out of poverty.

  We are not afraid to go after those parents who deliberately and repeatedly refuse to pay for their children.

  Curfew orders are another step towards providing the CMS with a full arsenal of powers to make sure children get the financial support they need to have the best start in life.


This builds on new powers introduced earlier this year to digitise all communications to parents and improvements to help the service trace the paying parent, calculate maintenance and enforce arrears more effectively.

The Child Maintenance consultation is published on Gov UK and closes on 12 August 2022.

21/12/2022,"The anticipated joint venture between ForFarmers and Boparan could lead to farmers paying higher prices to feed their poultry, the CMA has found.","
    
          ForFarmers and Boparan (through 2Agriculture) both manufacture and supply chicken and other types of poultry feed in the UK. ForFarmers and Boparan are planning to combine their animal feed milling operations in a joint venture. Between them, the firms operate 19 mills across the UK.

Following its Phase 1 investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found that the deal raises competition concerns in four local areas across East Anglia, north-western England and North Wales where it could lead to higher prices for poultry feed, lower quality feed or worse quality of service. While both businesses currently compete for customers within each of these local areas, the CMA is concerned that the combined business would not face sufficient competition after the merger.

The CMA is also concerned that the joint venture could unfairly favour Boparan’s chicken farming and processing businesses, resulting in less choice for smaller chicken farmers and processors, who might rely on ForFarmers and Boparan for their chicken feed.

During its Phase 1 investigation, the CMA received a number of complaints from customers and other market participants in relation to the impact this joint venture could have on choice of feed suppliers and poultry feed prices.

Sorcha O’Carroll, Senior Director of Mergers at the CMA, said:


  Feed is the biggest expense faced by farmers when rearing chicken, the UK’s favourite meat.

  With food prices already increasing and the wider cost of living crisis, it is vital that we don’t allow a reduction in competition between poultry feed suppliers, which could make this situation worse - both for farmers and shoppers at the check-out.


ForFarmers and Boparan now have 5 working days to submit proposals to address the CMA’s concerns. If suitable proposals are not submitted, the CMA will progress to an in-depth Phase 2 investigation.

For more information, visit the ForFarmers / Boparan JV case page.

Notes to editors

ForFarmers is a European manufacturer and supplier of animal feed, based in the Netherlands. 2Agriculture, a subsidiary of Boparan, is one of the UK’s largest suppliers of poultry feed by volume produced and uses its production to supply Hook 2 Sisters, a company affiliated with Boparan, as well as farmers on the open market.
  Following a Phase 1 review, the CMA has found that the merger gives rise to competition concerns in the local areas around four of the feed mills operated by the combined businesses, namely in Burston, Bury, Llay and Preston. The combined businesses would account for 50 to 60% of the supply of meat poultry feed to third parties in three of these local areas (Burston, Bury and Llay) and 40 to 50% in the fourth local area (Preston).

24/05/2022,"Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Thérèse Coffey, joined G7 employment ministers in Wolfsburg as part of the German presidency of the G7.","
    
          The meeting, which took place on Tuesday 24 May 2022, sought to build on the UK G7 agenda from 2021, which focussed on building back better, greener and more inclusively.

This year delegates focussed on structural change to the labour market in the context of decarbonisation, digitalisation and demographic change.

The Secretary of State outlined the UK’s commitment to achieving net zero by 2050, and delivering on the commitments made at COP26, including by greening pension scheme investments.

Work and Pensions Secretary Thérèse Coffey, said:


  Moving away from high carbon jobs to green jobs is a crucial part of achieving our net zero goals. The creation of high-quality jobs in sustainable sectors, ensures the opportunities are well paid.



  I very much support the sharing of knowledge and expertise with counterparts across the globe and welcome the opportunity to build on the UK’s G7 Presidency of 2021. It’s essential we work together to grow the economy to address the cost of living.


The UK published the Net Zero Strategy in 2021, committing to help businesses and consumers move to clean power, leveraging up to £90 billion of private investment by 2030, and reduce emissions across the economy by at least 68% by 2030 and 78% by 2035.

Through moving to green jobs or greening existing sectors, the government will support 190,000 green jobs across the UK by 2025 and a total of 440,000 net zero jobs, contributing to our goal to support two million green jobs by 2030.

The meeting closed with all delegates adopting a communique, agreeing concrete actions and joint steps towards a just transition and the creation of decent, high-quality work for a green economy.

To further promote continuity and to prioritize coordinated action across the G7 on critical labour, social and employment issues, delegates also established a standing Employment Working Group within the G7 with the aim to convene as ministers on an annual basis.

Japan will take over the G7 presidency in 2023.

09/08/2022,Prisoners are to be upskilled in cutting-edge farming techniques as the government continues to get offenders into work and cut crime.,"
    
          The scheme, being run at HMP Hewell in Worcestershire, is part of a landmark trial between the prison and farming technology company, LettUsGrow, that will see prisoners grow leafy greens, salad and herbs in high-tech ‘vertical’ farms.

Vegetables are grown in compact towers using aeroponics using an air or mist environment rather than soil.

At the forefront of farming, this advanced technology produces more plants, more quickly and with 98 percent less water than conventional methods.

Most importantly, the scheme will train prisoners up in the jobs of the future, such as farm management software, plant science and food safety. This will help them find a job on release in new and emerging technologies and dramatically reduce their chances of reoffending.

This is just the latest move in the government’s strategy to make sure prisoners use their time behind bars to get the skills they need to find work once through the gate and back home.

Prisons Minister Stuart Andrew MP:


  This innovative scheme is just the tip of the iceberg in our drive to equip prisoners with the practical skills they need to get a job on release – ultimately cutting crime and keeping the public safe.

  Up there with education, family ties and addiction treatment, stable work holds the key to a life free from crime and safer communities for us all.


Ralph Lubowski, Governor of HMP Hewell:


  I am delighted to partner with Lettus Grow in this fantastic initiative, which will give our prisoners the opportunity, confidence and training to turn their lives around.

  Vertical farming is an innovative, emerging industry and this partnership highlights our commitment to ensuring that prisoners are skilled up to find work on release.


The latest figures show the number of former offenders in work six weeks after release has increased by nearly half, whereas proven reoffending has fallen to just over 25 percent - making huge progress in tackling the £18 billion cost of repeat offending and keeping the public safe.

Notes to editors


The latest statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that the proportion of persons released from custody who were employed at 6 weeks from their release rose by 6 percentage points to 16 per cent between April 2021 and March 2021. This is an increase of more than half (57 per cent).
  New data shows that over the last 10 years, proven reoffending has decreased from 30.9 percent (2009/10) to 25.6 percent (2019/20).
  The Prisons White Paper – the Deputy Prime Minister’s strategy to reduce reoffending and keep the public safe – puts a laser-sharp focus in getting prisoners into work both behind bars and on release.

30/05/2022,The CMA has found that Cérélia’s purchase of the Jus-Rol business could lead to higher prices and lower quality products for shoppers in the UK.,"
    
          Cérélia is the largest manufacturer of bake-at-home dough products in the UK, producing private label (own brand) products on behalf of some of the largest grocery retailers in the UK.  Jus-Rol is the best-selling brand in the bake-at-home dough category and faces few branded rivals.

Some of Jus-Rol’s popular products include puff and shortcrust pastry dough, pizza dough and pain au chocolat dough.

Together, the businesses are the 2 leading suppliers of bake-at-home products to supermarkets and other grocery retailers and account for over two-thirds of sales of such products to shoppers in the UK. The Competition and Market Authority’s (CMA)  investigation has found that, prior to the merger, Jus-Rol’s branded products competed against private label products supplied by Cérélia for space on supermarket shelves.

Following the deal, Cérélia would produce and sell both the Jus-Rol products and private label products, leaving retailers with fewer alternatives. The CMA is therefore concerned that the loss of the Jus-Rol business as an independent player could lead to increased prices to grocery retailers – and ultimately consumers – and lower quality products.

Sorcha O’Carroll, Senior Director of Mergers said:


  Millions of people across the UK regularly use bake-at-home dough products, whether to rustle up a mid-week pizza for dinner or to make breakfast pastries for their families on the weekend.

  Consumers should know they’re getting value for money and not overpaying for their grocery products, especially as the current cost-of-living crisis stretches people’s budget even further. That’s why we won’t hesitate to refer this investigation further if our concerns aren’t addressed.


Cérélia now has 5 working days to submit proposals to address the CMA’s concerns. If suitable proposals are not submitted, the CMA will progress to an in-depth Phase 2 investigation.

For more information, visit the Cérélia / Jus-Rol merger inquiry page.

Notes to editors

All media enquiries should be directed to the CMA press office by email on press@cma.gov.uk, or by phone on 020 3738 6460.
  Cérélia refers to Cérélia Group Holding SAS (either directly or through entities under its common ownership or common control or over which it exerts material influence within the meaning of section 26 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act).
  The CMA believes that the merger gives rise to a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in the wholesale supply of bake-at-home dough products to grocery retailers in the UK.
  Under the Act the CMA has a duty to make a reference to Phase 2 if the CMA believes that it is or may be the case that a relevant merger situation has been created, or arrangements are in progress or contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation; and the creation of that situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.

30/07/2021,Natural England has launched a new scheme in Yorkshire to help conserve local populations of great crested newts while promoting sustainable development,"
    
          The scheme helps developers avoid costly delays and uses conservation payments to create new habitats for the protected species
This week an innovative new scheme to protect newts and promote sustainable development has been rolled out across Yorkshire.

Great crested newts have seen dramatic declines in their populations over the last 60 years despite being legally protected. The new ‘District Level Licensing’ scheme better protects this orange-bellied amphibian by using conservation payments from developers to create new ponds in locations that will benefit the species.

The scheme also benefits local people and authorities by avoiding costly delays for developers, helping to ensure homes are built and local authorities can deliver their plans.

The scheme will create a network of ponds across Yorkshire providing vital habitat for our biggest native newt, helping to join up sometimes isolated populations and helping them to thrive.

This week, District Level Licensing for Newts launched across seven local authority areas in North East Yorkshire: Ryedale, Scarborough, York, Selby, North York Moors National Park, Hambleton, and Redcar and Cleveland.

This means the new scheme is now available across Yorkshire and the whole of North East England. Developers in Yorkshire have already expressed interest in joining the scheme.

Craig Thomas, Natural England Natural England’s District Level Licensing Customer Relations Adviser, said:

“District level licensing is transforming a difficult planning process into one that is a real conservation success story.

“The rollout of this scheme in Yorkshire represents a win-win for both local developers and the future of this iconic species. It’s a fantastic example of working in partnership at a landscape scale and bringing improved conservation outcomes for our largest native newt - helping local populations to expand and link up across North East England. What’s more, the approach can also help meet our ambitions to build back greener.”

Alongside local authorities, Natural England is working in partnership with the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, Wildscapes and Tees Valley Wildlife Trust to create and maintain habitat for great crested newt which would otherwise be threatened by development.

Previously, developers had to apply for a mitigation licence before building on or around the places where newts live. Seasonal restrictions on work in places where the newts were present led to delays and uncertainty over the costs and scheduling of planned development. This new ‘landscape-scale’ licensing approach is better for both developers and newts. It provides a faster and more straightforward process than the traditional approach to licensing while helping to provide more homes for newts.

Thirty seven new ponds have already been created or restored for great crested newts, and together with our partners Natural England are already working on over one hundred more new ponds across Yorkshire. This new habitat will be monitored and looked after by our local, expert partners for 25 years – all funded by the initial payment.

Jeremy Garside, Chief Executive, Tees Valley Wildlife Trust said:

“We’re really pleased to be working with Natural England on this scheme. Our Wildlife Trust is already working with farmers and landowners who are committed to restoring habitats for other protected species such as water vole and barn owl; it is great to have this new opportunity to create newt ponds as well.

“Having witnessed a steady loss of ponds from the landscape over past decades, it is heartening to see this trend reversed and while ponds will be carefully designed to benefit great crested newts, we know that they will be of huge benefit to a much wider range of threatened wildlife species and will help to build networks of habitats which aid nature’s recovery.”

You can apply to join a district level licensing scheme to manage great crested newt populations if you are developing land on .gov.uk at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/great-crested-newts-district-level-licensing-schemes.

More about district level licensing in Yorkshire

Yorkshire is the latest area to launch a district level licensing scheme. This innovative, strategic approach to licensing is now available and being used by developers across 157 local authorities.
  This new licensing approach to authorising development affected by great crested newts is part of a larger programme to reform protected species licensing by focusing conservation effort where it will create maximum benefit. It aims to leave the environment in a better state than before.
  Previously, licences were only granted on a site-by-site basis. This missed opportunities to manage populations of great crested newts on a landscape scale and resulted in habitat for newts being squeezed around development, sometimes in disconnected patches.
  As part of the District Level Licensing project, Natural England has completed the largest ever survey of its type for great crested newts across England, funded by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The data is open and has been published to ArcGIS Online and is available at Data.gov.uk.
  Individual site-by-site mitigation licences are still available; since 17 February 2020, there is now a charge for these licences. In areas where there is a District Level Licensing scheme, joining a scheme will be the quickest option to enable development that affects great crested newts.

03/06/2021,"More than 1,000 new trainee probation officers have been recruited to bolster the vital work the Probation Service does to cut crime and protect the public, meeting a government target set last July.","
    
          

Probation Service recruits record 1,000 trainees in past year
  staffing boost will improve supervision of offenders and help cut crime
  further 1,500 to be recruited this year as services are unified


The 1,007 new recruits, a record number for a single year in the history of probation, will allow staff to keep an even closer eye on offenders, including the most dangerous, and prevent more people from becoming victims. That record is set to be smashed again this year, with a further 1,500 by March next year, thanks to an extra £310 million invested in the service over the last 2 years.

Probation officers supervise offenders leaving prison on licence and those serving community sentences. They protect the public by meeting regularly with offenders and ensuring they are complying with the conditions of their release from prison or sentence and not committing crime. The use of location-tracking GPS tags and close work with the police helps them to do this. They also ensure offenders  access services that reduce the risk of them committing more crime , including drug or alcohol treatment, accommodation and education.

Where offenders have been released from prison and breach their conditions or commit further offences, probation officers have the power to recall them back to prison, helping to cut crime and protect the public.

Increased staffing in the Probation Service means  probation officers will be able to supervise fewer offenders, and be better able to use their professional skills and legal powers to help stop offenders from committing more crime.

Prisons and Probation Minister Alex Chalk said:


  Probation officers are unsung crime fighters, sending offenders back to prison if they breach their licence conditions, and helping others turn their lives around so that they don’t commit more crime.

  These new recruits are a key part of our plan to make the country safer, alongside 20,000 more police officers, tougher sentences and the building of 18,000 new prison places.


Public safety will be boosted further later this month when the supervision of low and medium risk offenders comes back under public sector control, meaning that probation officers will be able to devote more time to the most high-risk offenders.

With reoffending accounting for around 80% of all recorded crime, these improvements to the service are designed to prevent thousands of people becoming victims each year and save some of the £18 billion annual cost of repeat offending.

As well as increasing the total number of probation officers in training, nearly 1 in 5 new recruits are from an ethnic minority, demonstrating that a crime-fighting career in the probation service is open and welcoming to all.

The Probation Service is working closely with experts in the charity sector who provide specialist services aimed at cutting crime. Last month it was announced that almost £200 million will be provided to charities and organisations across the country to deliver important  services to help offenders turn their backs on crime.

23/08/2020,"The Home of 2030 competition  encourages the design of environmentally friendly homes that support people in leading independent, fulfilling lives as our society ages. ","
    
          

Six finalists announced in competition to find the leading design for the low-carbon, age-friendly homes of the future
  Boost for low-carbon, modern home manufacturing as warranty providers work on shared standard for homes built using modern methods of construction
  Announcement follows overhaul of the planning system to deliver tree-lined streets and environmentally sustainable homes


Housing Minister Christopher Pincher has today (23 August 2020) announced 6 finalists in a competition to design the homes of the future.

The Home of 2030 competition has encouraged the best and brightest talents of the housing industry to design environmentally friendly homes that support people in leading independent, fulfilling lives as our society ages.

The 6 finalists and their designs are:


The Positive Collective (changebuilding Perpendicular Architecture & humblebee) with ECOSystems Technologies, COCIS and Arup: Homes that seek to reduce carbon emissions and encourage social interaction, including through food grown in communal spaces and areas such as ponds to promote biodiversity.
  
HLM Architects with the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and Green Build: Homes built using interchangeable parts with other homes, creating a circular economy in which little is wasted.
  
Igloo Regeneration with Useful Projects, Expedition Engineers and Mawson Kerr Architects: Homes with simple frame structures and standardised components set amidst walkable, vibrant neighbourhoods.
  
Openstudio Architects Ltd: Three building elements (a standardised housing module, an open ‘Loft’ and a circulation, storage and shared module) are used in combination with 3 landscape elements (communal green space, small private gardens or upper level balconies and terraces, and front gardens) to create combinations of sustainable, age-friendly spaces.
  
Outpost Architects and team: Janus, a home constructed from 98% organic biomass material (primarily timber and straw).
  
Studio OPEN: Promoting community and caring for others through a central garden shared between 4 homes that are built with locally sourced materials and timber construction methods to reduce environmental impact.
A winner will be chosen and together with other selected finalists will be introduced to Homes England development partners to explore the possibility of developing bids for a series of homes on Homes England land. The 6 finalists have each received £40,000 of funding to help them develop detailed plans.

Today’s announcements follow last week’s launch of Planning for the future – the government’s overhaul of the planning system to deliver more high-quality, sustainable homes.

The reforms include our commitment to making tree-lined streets the norm and an ambition that new ‘zero carbon ready’ homes delivered under the new system will not require any future retrofitting.

Housing Minister Rt Hon Christopher Pincher MP said:


  This competition demonstrates the best of British design being brought to bear on a key issue for today, and future generations: delivering homes that are good for the planet and that promote healthy, independent living for older generations.

  The winner of this competition will set the standard for the homes of the future and all 6 finalists have already made an exciting contribution to the designs we will need in the UK and around the world.


Minister for Clean Growth and Energy, Kwasi Kwarteng MP said:


  Cutting homeowners’ heating bills and making buildings greener is the next step in our plans to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and pioneering low-carbon initiatives like these will futureproof our housing stock for years to come.

  Alongside our nationwide £320 million heat network investment and our upcoming £2 billion Green Homes Grant scheme, these projects will pave the way for the UK’s green homes revolution.


Minister for Care, Helen Whately said:


  We want everyone, regardless of their age, to lead healthy, active lives in communities that work for them. As the population of the UK ages, our housing and infrastructure must be adaptable to our changing needs.

  The innovation and talent shown by the finalists in designing solutions to meet the needs of our future population has been very exciting and I look forward to seeing what comes next.


Alan Jones, President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, said:


  The UK urgently needs a broad mix of affordable, age-friendly and sustainable housing – and these shortlisted proposals provide exactly that. Through the clever configuration of private and public space, natural light and ventilation, intelligent use of materials and technologies – these cost-effective, low carbon homes show what’s possible when architects collaborate.


The winning Home of 2030 entry will be announced this autumn.

Home of 2030 applicants had to submit an outline design for homes that are:

Age-friendly and inclusive – appealing to a variety of age groups and adaptable to how needs will change as people become older.
  Have low environmental impact – applying technology and construction techniques to deliver net zero carbon emissions.
  Promote healthy living – promoting better health and wellbeing, such as through access to green spaces and communal areas.
  Deliverable and scalable – homes that can be rolled-out across the country.
Separately, in a boost for the manufacture of low-carbon homes, today the government announces that warranty providers have agreed to work towards a shared standard for assessing homes built using modern methods of construction (MMC).

Once delivered, the new standard will boost the MMC industry by making it simpler to secure a warranty for these homes. Industry research suggests these homes have the potential to be more environmentally sustainable, reducing heating bills by up to 70%.

Last year the United Kingdom became the first major economy in the world to sign a commitment to net-zero emissions into law, leading the way in tackling climate change. Homes are responsible for 25% of carbon emissions in the United Kingdom, and the new competition will place energy efficiency at the forefront of new home design.

As part of the government’s modern Industrial Strategy, the government is committed to ensuring that people can enjoy at least 5 extra years of healthy independent living by 2035. More than 10 million people in the UK today can expect to see their 100th birthday, compared to 15,000 current centenarians.

26/01/2017,Operational Take up of a Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) for small vessels in South Africa  ,"
    
          
Project Title
South Africa Safety Initiative for Small vessels’ Operational Take-Up (OASIS-TU)

Target Countries
South Africa and Madagascar

Proposal Lead
exactEarth Europe Limited

Project Consortium / International Partners
South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) - South Africa, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) – South Africa, Marine Data Solutions (MDSol) -  South Africa, Stone Three Venture Technology – South Africa, Le Centre de Fusion de l’Information Maritime (CFIM) – Madagascar

Project Summary
eEE have developed a satellite ‘Automatic Identification System’ (SAT-AIS) based technology to address the problem of practical tracking of small boats in developing countries - exactTrax  - as demonstrated on eEE’s IPSP-funded OASIS project. This saw a successful trial of exactTrax in partnership with the ‘South African Maritime Safety Authority’. Small fishing, work and leisure boats account for the majority of South African maritime accidents and incur millions of pounds annual expenditure on ‘Search and Rescue’ (SaR) activities. Knowing the up-to-date location of a boat is vital to saving lives and reducing SaR costs by thousands a year.

SAMSA is now mandating the use of satellite-AIS tracking for small boats, but requires initial assistance in its operational roll-out. OASIS-TU will deploy, under a new marine regulation, an initial 1,500 em-trak I100 AIS Identifiers across the poorest / most at-risk small boat sector in South Africa – artisanal fishing boats <10 metres. Underlying operational data services will be established through the South African company, MDSol, to underpin the project and beyond as the mandate rolls-out. 
OASIS-TU will also partner with the South African ‘National Sea Rescue Institute’ (RNLI equivalent) to broaden the availability/use of tracking data by safety organisations.

Finally, to widen platform options downstream to the economic benefit of South Africa through exports, we will partner with another South African company, Stone Three, who will integrate exactTrax into their AIS product line and trial this with the Madagascan ‘Le Centre de Fusion de l’Information Maritime’.

Objectives
Contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal 8.8: Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, in particular those in precarious employment. Specifically, the project should:

Save Lives – if a boat’s last location is known, or the Identifier’s SOS function is activated, authorities can better target where to search, and can rescue sailors more quickly.
  Reduce Search and Rescue (SaR) Costs – if a boat’s last location is known or the Identifier’s SOS function is activated, authorities can better target where to search. Savings can then be spent elsewhere.
  Grow South African Business – locally offer wider maritime information services & engagement of South African software and electronic developers in the development of new technologies.

01/07/2019,High Streets Minister Jake Berry announces 4 successful applicants to the Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) Loan Fund.,"
    
          Four local communities are to receive a funding boost of a share of over £100,000 to help make their areas more attractive for business, High Streets Minister Jake Berry MP has today (1 July 2019) confirmed.

The latest round of the Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) Loan Fund will support business owners and local leaders to set-up a BID, bringing communities together to deliver additional local services and transform commercial areas.

This will empower local business communities to undertake the projects they believe will deliver lasting economic benefit.

The four successful applicants to the BIDs Loan Fund are: Armley, Leeds; Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire; Christchurch, Dorset; and Digbeth, Birmingham.

High Streets Minister Jake Berry MP said:


  Business Improvement Districts in partnership with local authorities, developers and communities, are working hard to champion town centres, by deciding what improvements they want to see, how these will be managed and what it will cost.



  Those high streets and town centres performing strongest often have BIDs at their core, driving improvements that boost footfall, encourage consumer spending and ensure our high streets are fit for the future.


Today’s announcement comes during the second Great British High Street Week, a week of activity to celebrate high streets up and down the country and share the work that Government is undertaking to support them. The Great British High Street Awards are part of this work, and entries are due to close shortly.

The Awards not only celebrate the best high streets across the nation, but also champion ‘Rising Stars’ – the most ambitious high streets which are taking a lead and working together to revive, adapt and diversify.

A selection of 40 shortlisted finalists will be chosen by our independent judging panel. Those shortlisted high streets are eligible to win up to £15,000 for their local community.

From Altrincham to Watford, BIDS serve as a tried and tested model of how local business can work together to realise the potential of towns and high streets by engaging strategically with local authorities, developers and communities.

The government is fully committed to supporting high streets and town centres and has implemented a number of measures to address challenges being faced in these areas, including cutting business rates by a third to give high street retailers a boost.

On top of the £13 billion rates relief package since 2016, a £675 million Future High Streets Fund was announced last year to help high streets adapt.

18/05/2020,Protect your property from illegal waste activities,"
    
          The Environment Agency is urging residents and owners of land and property across the North East to be extra vigilant in the protection of their property, and also checking out the credentials of any independent waste carriers to avoid becoming victims of waste crime during the continued Coronavirus lockdown.

Don’t get dumped on as it could cost you! If it sounds too good to be true – it probably is.

These uncertain times are the perfect opportunity for criminals to take advantage of unsuspecting victims especially when householders are creating more refuse and sorting through unwanted items during the clearance of outhouses and garages.

That coupled with the recent temporary closure of most Household Waste and Recycling Centres has meant that people have been desperate to clear some much-needed space and remove their clutter. So it may be tempting to answer that advert on Facebook for someone to come and clear the waste – but be aware.

The annual economic impact of waste crime in England is an estimated at £604M. The Environment Agency is working hard to address this. Its specialist crime unit uses intelligence to track and prosecute organised crime gangs involved in illegal waste activity and to ensure any necessary action is taken against them.

David Edwardson, the Environment Agency’s Enforcement Leader for the North East, said:


  Waste crime is something that not only affects the environment in which we live and work but it can be an awful experience for residents, landowners and businesses who fall victim to these acts of criminal activity.



  This is why, as the regulator for the commercial waste industry, we are urging individuals, businesses and organisations to be cautious, extra vigilant and responsible with the management of their waste.  This will prevent it getting into the hands of criminals – who cause damage and heartache to properties and the local economy.


Did you know that in a court of law it’s not only the waste carrier who can be prosecuted if waste is fly tipped? It’s expected that the customer knows the final destination of the waste [duty of care]. If you pass your waste to someone else to take away for you, you must first check they are registered with the Environment Agency.

There is a risk to landowners too. Waste criminals can target your land and property. They may offer you cash to store waste, promising to come back and remove it but don’t. Or they may dump the waste without your knowledge.

The threat to those land and property owners comes in various means from baled waste appearing unexpectedly through to people answering adverts on social media platforms placed by illegal unlicensed waste carriers promising to remove items for a one-off fee.

Large scale illegal dumping of waste is often co-ordinated through organised crime groups. These criminal groups approach property and landowners to lease warehouses, barns, open land, farms and private property. Lease agreements are put in place that appear to be legal and above board.

Organised crime groups then leave waste on land, where the clearance of the waste becomes the responsibility of the landowners, often at great expense. The criminals involved often provide false details to secure their lease agreements making them harder to trace and to recover costs from.

The Coronavirus is not an excuse for criminals to get away with operating illegally. The Environment Agency is still actively responding to reports of illegal activity and waste sites operating illegally during this pandemic.

Check out the Environment Agency’s operational update at www.gov.uk/government/news/environment-agency-operational-update-3-april-2020

David Edwardson continues:


  We are working closely with our partners to deliver a programme of preventative measures to help protect individuals especially in these current times when criminals prey on people’s vulnerability.



  You may even be committing an offence yourself by allowing waste to be stored on your land or in your property without the relevant permissions which could leave you liable to prosecution.


There are hundreds of commercial properties across the North East thought to be empty, all of which are potential targets for waste criminals.

Northumbria Police’s Designing Out Crime Officer, Sandra Killeen, said:


  We all have to be accountable for responsibly disposing of our waste as it can have damaging effects on the environment and the economy.



  We are working alongside our partners to ensure anyone linked to criminal activity and illegal disposing of waste sees the full consequences of their actions.



  We are urging the public to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious.


James Copeland, Senior Environment & Land Use Adviser, said:


  When accepting any material, especially waste onto farm, there are a number of waste regulations you must be aware of. Depositing unsuitable materials could leave you with an expensive clean-up costs or facing prosecution. There are a number of key checks and questions you need to ask when accepting waste and if in doubt, contact the competent authority for advice.


Everybody has a part to play to help solve the waste crime problem and make sure waste is managed responsibly. Anyone who sees waste crime taking place, or who has been a victim of illegal baled waste deposit is advised not to approach as these people can be dangerous. Report it by calling our incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Also if people are paying for a company to take away waste from their property, then we would always advise them to check they are a registered waste carrier with the Environment Agency by visiting environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/view/search-waste-carriers-brokers

19/12/2019,"Plans announced to help home-buyers and renters, devolve power and funding to communities and improve building safety.","
    
          

Better deal for renters with new lifetime deposit – making the process of moving home easier and cheaper for millions
  Confirmation of plans to abolish ‘no-fault’ evictions – preventing landlords from evicting tenants at short notice and without good reason
  Government also announces plans to slash the cost of new homes for local people and key workers in their area by up to a third
  New English devolution white paper to unleash potential of all regions across the country – levelling up every city, town and county
  Biggest change to building safety laws for 40 years to deliver new safety framework for high-rise buildings – ensuring residents’ concerns never go ignored


A revolutionary new deal for renters will restore fairness, honesty and transparency to the heart of the housing market, thanks to new proposals unveiled as part of the Queen’s Speech.

Under the plans, millions of renters will benefit from a new lifetime deposit scheme, which will see their hard-earned deposit move with them from property to property – giving tenants more control over their lives and keeping more of their cash in their pocket.

Proposals to abolish no-fault evictions have also been confirmed, meaning landlords will no longer be able to uproot tenants from their homes at short notice and with no good reason – bringing greater security to millions of families who live in rented accommodation.

This will be matched with new powers to strengthen the rights of landlords to gain possession of their property through the courts when they have a clearly valid reason to do so, in order to create a fair market where good and responsible landlords flourish.

The government has also announced plans which will make owning a home more affordable. This includes the new First Home scheme making homes available at a discount for local first-time buyers.

Councils will be able to use housing developers’ contributions to discount homes by 30% for people who cannot otherwise afford to buy in their area. The Affordable Homes Programme will also be renewed, building more homes for rent and delivering a new shared ownership offer.

The Queen’s Speech has also set out further detail for new legislation to bring an end to the unscrupulous practice of unnecessary leaseholds – introducing new laws to ban new houses being sold on a leasehold basis and reducing ground rents for new leases to zero.

Welcoming the Speech, Housing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  The announcements made in the Queen’s Speech today will empower both home-buyers and renters. The legislation that we will bring forward will provide a better deal for renters through our lifetime deposit scheme while also protecting them from no fault evictions. We will also help first-time buyers get a foot on the property market with 30% discounts for local people and key workers.

  We are moving forward with legislation to set ground rents to zero, abolish leasehold houses and prioritise the safety of residents with the biggest change to building safety laws for 40 years.

  I look forward to getting on with this ambitious and exciting agenda.


Housing

As well as the measures for renters, local first-time buyers and reforms to the leasehold market, the government has also outlined plans to which will ensure any new housing is accompanied by essential infrastructure. A white paper will also be published on reforming the planning system to ensure it works better for the public and small builders.

Devolution and local growth

New proposals to unleash the potential of all regions across England will be brought forward in a devolution white paper in the coming months – devolving power and funding to people and places so that every part of the country can shape its own destiny. 

The English devolution white paper will be at the heart of the government’s commitment to levelling up every city, town and county across the country.

Already 37% of residents in England, and almost 50% in the North, are now served by city region mayors with powers and money to prioritise local issues, drive significant infrastructure projects and act as a local champion for the area.

The white paper will set the strategy for expanding the benefits of devolution across England, as well as putting more trust in local people to choose what is best for their communities and lead the way on our domestic agenda.

Ministers have also confirmed plans to bring forward new and revitalised strategies for the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine, as well as the UK Shared Prosperity Fund.

Building safety

In the biggest change to building safety laws for 40 years, the government will take forward the recommendations from Dame Judith Hackitt’s independent review of building regulations and fire safety through a new Building Safety Bill.

Legislation will:

provide clearer accountability for, and stronger duties on, those responsible for the safety of high-rise buildings throughout design, construction and occupation
  give residents a stronger voice in the system, ensuring their concerns are not ignored and they fully understand how they can contribute to maintaining safety in their buildings
  strengthen enforcement and sanctions to deter non-compliance with the new regime in order to hold the right people to account
In addition to these major reforms, the government will take forward swift action to introduce legislation to implement the recommendations of the Grenfell Tower Public Inquiry Phase 1 Report through changes to the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, as soon as possible.

Over the coming weeks and months, ministers will work with residents, building owners and others to ensure legislation delivers the fundamental changes needed so that all people – regardless of where they live – feel safe in their homes.

New legislation will also be brought forward to require developers of new build homes to belong to a New Home Ombudsman.

Domestic abuse

To bolster life-saving support for survivors of domestic abuse, the government has confirmed it intends to amend the landmark Domestic Abuse Bill to include for the first time a new legal duty on councils to provide safe accommodation for those fleeing violent relationships.

The Bill will transform the response to domestic abuse to better protect survivors and their children and ensure they have the support they need, while pursuing their abusers.

The move will also bring an end to the postcode lottery of support for those fleeing abusive relationships, and ensure all survivors can get the help they need to rebuild their lives.

This comes months after ministers announced a further £15 million in funding to run these essential services in 2020-2021 – a 20% increase on 2019-2020.

Business rates revaluation

And to ensure business rate payers in England have bills that more accurately reflect current property values, ministers will bring forward legislation to increase the frequency of business rates revaluations.

Business rates revaluations will increase to every 3 years, from the current 5 years, and the next revaluation will be brought forward a year from 2022 to 2021 to ensure businesses see the benefits of this change as soon as possible.

A property’s business rates bill is based on a precise estimate of the premises’ rental value. Business rates revaluations help ensure this estimate accurately reflects the market value of the property and maintain fairness by redistributing the total amount payable across the country.

09/07/2019,The NHS will test the world's first ‘subscription’ style payment model to incentivise pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs for resistant infections.,"
    
          The new trial will be led by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and NHS England and NHS Improvement.

It will test a ‘subscription’ style model that pays pharmaceutical companies upfront for access to drugs based on their usefulness to the NHS.

This will make it more attractive for companies to invest the estimated £1 billion it costs to develop a new drug, as they can be reassured they will still be paid for the drug even though it may be stored for reserves.

Currently, drugs companies are paid by volume of antibiotics sold, while the NHS is trying to reduce their use to prevent antimicrobial resistance (AMR). 

Low returns on investment in development mean industry is reluctant to invest in the research and clinical trials necessary to bring new antibiotics to market.

NICE and NHS England and NHS Improvement are calling for companies to identify products to be considered for the initial phase of the test. 

The work will be evaluated from the start and findings will be shared with the rest of the world so that other healthcare systems can test similar models.

Antibiotics have started to fail, with resistant bacteria already causing more than 700,000 deaths globally every year, making it vital that antibiotics are used only when needed.

Today’s announcements follows the government’s 2040 AMR vision and 5-year national action plan, published in January, and the appointment of Professor Dame Sally Davies as the first UK Special Envoy on AMR.

The latest phase of the ‘Keep Antibiotics Working Campaign’ will launch at the beginning of coughs and colds season this October to help reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, said:


  There is no greater threat to global health than drug-resistant infections, yet there have been no major new antibiotic drug classes discovered since the 1980s. 

  Imagine a world in which a papercut can lead to infection that can’t be controlled. We must stop that from happening. Tackling superbugs needs global leadership and peoples’ lives depend on us finding a new way forward.  

  Our NHS is in a unique position to take a global lead in testing new payment models. We will take the lead but this is a global problem and we cannot succeed alone.

   I am proud the UK is taking the first steps towards a solution and I am urging the rest of the world to join us in the fight against superbugs.


Health Minister Nicola Blackwood said:


  Having a full pipeline of antimicrobials is critical in our efforts to address AMR, but currently not enough pharmaceutical companies are investing in the development of new drugs.

  This project is an important step but it will only address global market failure if other countries do the same, which is why we want to involve as many countries as we can and share our learning from this work.

  Today we are sending a strong signal to the rest of the world that there are workable models to stimulate investment in these vital medicines and that together we can tackle AMR.

09/09/2019,Environment Agency teams are relocating hundreds of native crayfish to help boost their numbers.,"
    
          Hundreds of native crayfish have been carefully hand-collected and moved to a remote refuge as part of a project to grow their numbers.

Environment Agency ecologists have relocated the white-clawed crayfish – a protected species under threat across the country – to sites where their populations can flourish out of harm’s way.

The new sites are free of the larger, more aggressive, invasive signal crayfish – which outcompete the native species for food and habitat and carry a disease fatal to the UK species.

In a day-long operation, a dozen officers collected around 350 native crayfish from a stretch of the River Witham near Grantham, checked their size, health and gender, and moved them to a secret site on a Lincolnshire lake.

Regular monitoring will keep tabs on their numbers as the crayfish distribute across their new home and start to breed.

The work is part of a national scheme known as the ‘Ark project’, aiming to secure the future of white-clawed crayfish in England. The species has been in decline since non-native American signal crayfish escaped into UK waters in the 1970s.

This relocation is the second such rescue in the county after a similar effort in 2017 saw hundreds of crayfish successfully transferred to chalk streams in the Lincolnshire Wolds. Surveys carried out in the area since have confirmed the crayfish are breeding and boosting the population.


The crayfish will be examined by EA officers before being moved to their new locationRichard Chadd, senior environmental monitoring officer with the Environment Agency, said:


  Lincolnshire’s flat, open rivers and pristine chalk streams are a haven for native crayfish, making our county one of the largest strongholds in England for this protected species.



  They’re a vital part of the local ecology, which is why we’re working so hard to protect them – and these efforts are just part of our ongoing work to improve the environment for people and nature.


White-clawed crayfish, named for the pale colour of the underside of their claws, are the country’s largest native freshwater crustaceans. Generally growing to 30 – 40mm in length, some can live up to 12 years and reach 120mm long from tip to tail.

The Ark project is just one example of the work being done as part of the government’s 25 year environment plan to protect and improve the environment within this generation.

Collectively, non-native invasive species cost the UK economy an estimated £1.7 billion every year.

Everyone can do their part to prevent the spread of invasive species and protect native ones by taking care to follow the biosecurity steps of thoroughly checking, cleaning and drying your clothes and equipment any time you’ve been in the water.

07/03/2023,"Professor John Deanfield, CBE announced as the first ever Government Champion for Personalised Prevention.","
    
          
Professor John Deanfield, CBE will explore how people can live longer, healthier lives by using technology, intelligence and data to predict, prevent and diagnose risk factors for cardiovascular disease
  It could help reduce pressure on the NHS by tackling the quarter of a million hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease each year
People across England stand to benefit from a project to identify radical new approaches to prevent cardiovascular disease and reduce pressure on the NHS, following the appointment of Professor John Deanfield as Government Champion for Personalised Prevention today [Tuesday 7 March].

Professor Deanfield - who is a professor of cardiology at University College London and led a review into the NHS Health Check in 2021 - has been asked by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to explore and expand the role of technology, so people can better look after their health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The Government Champion for Personalised Prevention will lead a taskforce with expertise on health policy, health technology, behavioural science, big data and health economics. His taskforce will develop a set of evidence-based recommendations to deliver a vision for a modern, personalised cardiovascular disease prevention service.

They will explore a range of ideas, including the use of personalised data to better predict and prevent ill health. They’ll also look at how the latest health technology could be used to predict, prevent, diagnose and treat key risk factors for cardiovascular disease and other health conditions.

Cardiovascular disease and its risk factors are major drivers of ill-health, economic inactivity and premature death. It accounts for up to 250,000 hospital admissions and around 140,000 deaths in England each year and costs the NHS approximately £7.4 billion annually.

Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Steve Barclay, said:


  Technology is crucial to a forward-looking, modern NHS, and Professor Deanfield’s work will help us understand how people across the country could use it in their day-to-day lives and prevent cardiovascular disease.

  These conditions account for a quarter of a million hospital admissions a year, and cost the NHS billions of pounds - this ambitious project could see real impact on those who suffer from, or are at risk of this disease.


The appointment is expected to last at least 6 months. He will put forward a series of recommendations to government following his work, which will:

identify new ways of predicting, preventing, diagnosing and treating major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, using the latest health technology, intelligence and data
  advise on how individuals, businesses and public services could be incentivised to support prevention outside of the NHS
  predict and manage disease more effectively using personalised data
  create new partnerships to innovate the way in which we deliver preventative services, bringing care closer to home and communities
  identify how this vision for cardiovascular disease prevention might impact on conditions with shared risk factors, such as diabetes and dementia
Government Champion for Personalised Prevention, Professor John Deanfield, CBE, said:


  I am thrilled to continue my work with the government on cardiovascular disease prevention. This appointment provides a real opportunity to radically rethink our approach to cardiovascular health and disease prevention and I’m confident we have the right people around the table to do this.

  We intend to build on my recent review of the NHS Health Check and evolve this vision into an ongoing, life-long programme that empowers people to take control of predicting, managing and reducing their lifetime cardiovascular risk.


The appointment of Professor Deanfield builds on the other tech initiatives the government is exploring. These include an NHS Digital Health Check trial in Cornwall and the pilot of the Better Health: Rewards app in Wolverhampton which will incentivise people to eat better and move more.

The news of Professor Deanfield’s appointment coincides with the publication of the Office of Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) quarterly NHS Health Check data, England’s cardiovascular disease prevention scheme.

It shows 677,118 offers were made and 271,899 checks carried out in quarter 3 in 2022 to 2023, up from 300,877 and 136,100 respectively in the same quarter in 2021 to 2022.

NHS national medical director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, said:


  While NHS action has already contributed to significant reductions over the last 3 decades, cardiovascular disease remains a major cause of premature death and disability, particularly hitting healthy life expectancy for people in the least well-off areas.

  Finding new ways of combining data and technology with on the ground services has real potential to prevent illness, saving more lives and reducing the cost of cardiovascular disease to the NHS in the long term, so we look forward to working with Professor Deanfield and partners to identify the most promising opportunities.


To improve further the numbers of eligible people completing the NHS Health Check, a new digital check is being tested and evaluated in Cornwall. This came off the back of the review led by Professor Deanfield in 2021 and a report is expected in 2023.

The government is now exploring how to make a digital NHS Health Check available nationally, alongside the in-person check. The check will help users take action to improve their health independently, link to national and local services and enable general practice to start clinical care where appropriate. This work will tie in closely with the overall vision of the Government Champion for Personalised Prevention.

Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said:


  We warmly welcome the government’s commitment to prevent cardiovascular disease and that this work will be led by an expert in the field. Tackling cardiovascular disease is one of the best opportunities to save the most lives, as the NHS Long Term Plan makes clear.

  This important role could help to unlock innovative new ways to keep people healthy for longer and help to reduce pressure on the NHS at the same time. We are looking forward to working with Professor Deanfield in his new post.


About 8 in every 10 cases of cardiovascular disease can be attributed to modifiable risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, poor diet and smoking. These key risk factors are also associated with a range of other major health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and types of dementia.

30/06/2022,"Half a million people have been supported into work in less than 6 months thanks to “Way to Work”, a government drive to get jobseekers into vacancies.","
    
          Over 500,000 jobseekers have been supported to find work through their jobcentre as government meets its target, helping to grow the economy
  Benefit claimants moved into work at a record rate in April 2022 as part of the “Way to Work” drive
  Hundreds of employers across the UK benefit, saving money on recruitment costs and filling vacancies fast
Launched in January, ministers set the target of supporting 500,000 jobseekers through the jobcentre and into employment by the end of June. This coincided with the need to fill a record number of job vacancies as the economy rebounded after the pandemic.

Unemployment now stands at an almost 50 year low with 627,000 more people in payroll employment compared to pre-pandemic levels.

The nation’s attitudes have been transformed, with many jobseekers taking on roles in new sectors and employers recruiting through jobcentres for the first time. To keep up momentum, the department will continue to bring jobseekers face to face with employers, helping more people find work and earn a wage.

Prime Minister, Boris Johnson said:


  In less than six months we’ve helped half a million people - who have so far been struggling to find employment - into work. This is a massive success, especially in the context of some of the global economic pressures we’ve been facing.

  Helping people find the security of a stable income, through a job they can take pride in, is one of the best ways for people to support their families during these challenging times.

  That’s why we’re stepping up targeted support measures to ensure everyone can find a job that’s right for them, develop their skills and climb up the career ladder.


Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Thérèse Coffey said:


  When people needed jobs and the economy needed workers, we stepped up our efforts to connect jobseekers with employers and have delivered on our target to get 500,000 more people into work in less than six months.

  Our ABC approach to help people get Any job first, a Better job next and into a Career is off to a flying start. With people in jobs, we can move to the next stage – helping them progress in-work and boost their earnings.


Minister for Employment, Mims Davies MP said:


  After this huge success, we’re determined to get everyone, at any age or career stage, the support they need to get back into work.

  We’re stepping up our targeted support for older workers, those living with health conditions and for people who have been out of work for more than 12 months, ensuring everyone can find a job that’s right for them, earn a wage and have the opportunity to progress.

  As part of “Way to Work”, rules for job-ready claimants were changed, requiring them to broaden their job search after one month to include sectors new to them.


The Department for Work and Pensions also worked with employers to short-circuit their recruitment practices, getting hiring managers and jobseekers in front of each other in jobcentres across the UK, leading to an ‘on the spot’ hiring approach, getting people earning quicker, and reducing hiring costs for employers.

Following the success of the jobs drive, ministers have renewed a focus on supporting in-work progression for workers across the country through the national network of jobcentres.

Having picked up the roles that the economy needed, people are now being supported by their jobcentre to progress, helping them to earn more money, get more hours, and use their experience as a springboard for their career.

In addition, the Department for Work and Pensions is focused on supporting the long-term unemployed, older workers and those with health conditions to find work, helping the UK maximise employment and supporting economic growth.

Midlife MOT’s will help older workers take stock of their skills and finances, and take advantage of those years in work over 50, which we know can often be the most interesting and lucrative.

In addition, ministers have committed to spending £1.3 billion to support people with disability and health challenges into work, building on the expansion of Disability Employment Advisers.

And because returning to work can be more difficult after an extended period of unemployment, the government’s Restart Scheme will give jobseekers a year of intensive support to help get them back on the job ladder, and is already supporting a quarter of a million back into work.

10/03/2023,The Government Office for Technology Transfer (GOTT) has funded the National Physical Laboratory’s development of new ultrasound technology in breast cancer diagnosis.,"
    
          
Background

Women with ‘significantly denser’ breast tissue are around 6 times more likely to develop breast cancer than those with ‘low breast density’. Breast density is currently estimated from mammogram and MRI scans, which leaves detection open to clinical judgement and therefore potential room for error.

The knowledge asset solution

The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is developing innovative new ultrasound technology which provides quantitative measurements of breast tissue composition and has the potential to make a significant impact in breast density assessment. The technology can also help with breast cancer diagnosis and monitoring the response to treatment.

Who will this help?

Patients: Over 700,000 women in the UK are living with undetected high breast density
  Clinicians: Supporting doctors to identify women with high breast density with safe, consistent and reliable technology available outside of a hospital setting
  NHS: Earlier detection of  breast cancer can reduce the cost of treatment and save lives
Funding awards

NPL were awarded £93,954 in the ‘Expand’ phase of the Knowledge Asset Grant Fund (KAGF) in November 2021 and were awarded an additional £199,312 in September 2022 in the ‘Extend’ phase to further develop this technology.


GOTT’s role

GOTT immediately saw the potential for the further development of this public sector owned knowledge asset, and its potential benefits to patients and the healthcare sector. The evidence presented by NPL was strong and an excellent example of how the KAGF can be used to support government bodies to exploit and leverage their knowledge assets and, in this case, improve the diagnosis of cancer.

Quote from NPL


Daniel Sarno, a research scientist at the National Physical Laboratory and a member of the NHS Clinical Entrepreneur Programme, said:


  While the technology is currently in the research phase, we are encouraged by our in-person results and excited for the technology journey from bench top to bedside. The Knowledge Assets Grant Fund has enabled us to continue to pursue our vision for getting this technology into the market and used by those who can benefit from it.

07/06/2022,"Today, 7 June, member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) agreed to ambitious new plans to boost sustainability and inclusivity in employment, as the UK chaired the first Employment and Labour Ministerial since before the pandemic.","
    
          UK Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey, chairs first OECD Ministerial meeting on employment and labour markets since 2016
  Ministers from all 38 countries agree to ambitious pledge to focus on sustainability, equality and young people
  Members condemn Russian aggression, whose participation with the OECD was suspended in March this year
Supporting careers for young people was at the heart of the agreement adopted by ministers from all OECD countries, as part of their commitment to create more diverse, sustainable, and robust labour markets.

Led by UK Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey, the discussion focused on the impacts of the pandemic as well as recent challenges, such as the rise in the cost of living triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The UK minister addressed her counterparts with insight into the UK’s successful experience of building a strong labour market post-pandemic. Latest data shows the UK currently has a national unemployment rate of 3.7% – the lowest since 1974 with over a million more disabled people in work since 2017.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Thérèse Coffey said:


  The importance of focusing on decent, sustainable and high-quality work for all was shared by international ministers around the table today, along with a commitment to promote life-long learning and build inclusivity in our workforce.



  As we move on from the pandemic, and face common issues in our labour markets, we must continue to work together to find united solutions and build a fairer and greener global economy.


Delegates also condemned the ongoing Russian aggression, as countries stood in solidarity with Ukraine, after a decision was taken to suspend Russia’s participation in OECD activity in March 2022.

Last year, the UK’s G7 Presidency made it a priority to get people back into quality and more sustainable jobs and invest in skills to boost economic recovery.

Today’s Employment and Labour Ministerial, which was held with an official theme of looking beyond the COVID-19 crisis to a better labour market that works for all, reflected the UK’s ongoing commitment to building a strong and inclusive labour market, including working internationally to tackle gender pay gaps.

Ministers also agreed to put environmental challenges at the heart of their plans, and support workers to transition to sustainable sectors, aligning with a key ambition set out by the UK Prime Minister at the COP26 Climate Change summit in Glasgow to create millions of green jobs by unlocking both public and private sector cash.

26/05/2022,The CMA is investigating whether Google has broken the law by restricting competition in the digital advertising technology market.,"
    
          CMA launches second investigation into Google’s practices in ad tech, following launch of probe into Google and Meta’s ‘Jedi Blue’ agreement.
Advertising technology intermediation, also known as the ‘ad tech stack’, is a complex set of services which facilitate the sale of online advertising space between sellers (publishers, like online newspapers and other content providers) and buyers (advertisers). In 2019, UK advertisers spent around £1.8 billion on this kind of online advertising. The market is important because millions of people across the UK use websites that rely on advertising revenue to offer high-quality, free content.

Google has strong positions at various levels of the ad tech stack, charging fees to both publishers and advertisers.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is examining 3 key parts of this chain, in each of which Google owns the largest service provider:

Demand-side platforms (DSPs) allow advertisers and media agencies to buy publishers’ advertising inventory (i.e. the space they have for advertising) from many sources.
  Ad exchanges provide the technology to automate the sale of publishers’ inventory. They allow real-time auctions by connecting to multiple DSPs, collecting bids from them.
  Publisher ad servers manage the publisher’s inventory and decide which ad to show, based on the bids received from different exchanges and/or direct deals between publishers and advertisers.
The CMA is assessing whether Google’s practices in these parts of the ad tech stack may distort competition. These include whether Google limited the interoperability of its ad exchange with third-party publisher ad servers and/or contractually tied these services together, making it more difficult for rival ad servers to compete.

The CMA is also concerned that Google may have used its publisher ad server and its DSPs to illegally favour its own ad exchange services, while taking steps to exclude the services offered by rivals.

Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s Chief Executive, said:


  We’re worried that Google may be using its position in ad tech to favour its own services to the detriment of its rivals, of its customers and ultimately of consumers.

  This would be bad for the millions of people who enjoy access to a wealth of free information online every day.

  Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers, who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs or put their content behind paywalls. It may also be raising costs for advertisers which are passed on through higher prices for advertised goods and services.

  It’s vital that we continue to scrutinise the behaviour of the tech firms which loom large over our lives and ensure the best outcomes for people and businesses throughout the UK.


This case follows on from the CMA’s market study into online platforms and digital advertising which identified significant issues and made an assessment of possible solutions to address market power in ad tech. The CMA will consider these further in the course of its investigation. The CMA has subsequently opened a competition investigation into Google and Meta’s ‘Jedi Blue’ agreement in relation to header bidding services, which are a part of the wider ad tech stack. The CMA is also monitoring compliance with commitments Google made in relation to its Privacy Sandbox proposals to remove third-party cookies and other functionality from Google’s Chrome browser.

A draft Bill to give the CMA more powers to govern the behaviour of big tech firms, through the Digital Markets Unit, was recently announced in the Queen’s Speech.

Until this legislation is in place, the CMA will forge ahead using its existing powers in the tech sector, including probes into Apple’s App Store, Meta’s use of data and Apple and Google’s mobile ecosystems over competition concerns.

The CMA maintains a joined-up approach across all related cases to ensure the best outcomes for people and businesses throughout the UK.

The European Commission (EC) has launched its own investigation into Google’s practices in the ad tech sector. Google practices are also the subject of a complaint by the State of Texas (PDF, 3.28MB) (and other US States) currently in the US courts. In July 2021, the French Autorité de la Concurrence closed a similar case against Google (PDF, 1.35MB) having imposed a fine and secured commitments.

Notes to editors

The competition legislation relevant to the CMA’s investigation is the Competition Act 1998. This case concerns Chapter II prohibition (which makes it illegal for a company that holds a dominant position from behaving to the detriment of competition).
  “Google” refers to Google UK Limited, Google LLC and Alphabet Inc.
  The CMA may launch an investigation under the Competition Act 1998 if it has reasonable grounds to believe that there has been an infringement of competition law. If the CMA decides that there has been a breach of competition law then it can impose a fine up to 10% of Google’s worldwide turnover, as well as issue legally binding directions to bring the breach to an end.
  No conclusion should be made that the law has been broken. The CMA has made no decision that Google’s conduct needs to change.

10/03/2022,"UK has “sleepwalked” into a system in which children are failing to get suitable placements in foster care and children’s homes, finds new report published today.","
    
          

Market study recommends development of national and regional bodies to support local authorities with getting suitable placements for children
  CMA also seeking to address concerns about financial stability of private children’s home providers and high profits in the sector, through financial health assessments and by boosting in-house foster care


The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a market study into children’s social care in March 2021.

The final report, published today, found there is a shortage of appropriate places in children’s homes and with foster carers, meaning that some children are not getting the right care from their placement. Some children are also being placed too far away from where they previously lived or in placements that require them to be separated from their siblings.

This shortage also means that high prices are often being paid by local authorities, who are responsible for placing children in appropriate settings, with these costs picked up by taxpayers. The CMA’s analysis finds that the main reason for this is the fragmented system by which services are commissioned, which means that local authorities are not able to leverage their role as the purchasers of placements or to plan properly for the future.

To address these issues, the CMA is recommending that the UK Government, Scottish and Welsh Governments create or develop national and regional organisations that could support local authorities with their responsibilities in this sector. These would improve commissioning by carrying out and publishing national and regional analysis and providing local authorities and collective bodies with guidance and by supporting them to meet more placement needs in their local area.

The CMA is also concerned about the financial resilience of some private providers of children’s homes in England and Wales, particularly those financed through private equity. High levels of debt among these firms could lead to them getting into financial difficulties, which could impact the care provided to children.

To address these issues, the CMA is proposing:

a system for assessing the financial health of the most difficult to replace providers of children’s homes and providing warnings to relevant authorities if a failure is likely;
  that options are actively explored for bringing foster care in-house;
  a review of the barriers to provision of children’s homes, as well as the recruitment and the retention of care staff and foster carers.
Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:


  The UK has sleepwalked into a dysfunctional children’s social care market.  This has left local authorities hamstrung in their efforts to find suitable and affordable placements in children’s homes or foster care.

  We have also identified issues with the financial stability of children’s home providers. It is important to manage the risk of children’s homes providers going bust and local authorities having to pick up the pieces.

  Local authorities cannot be left to face these challenges alone. There are several areas where national governments should make changes to address issues in the sector, including new financial oversight of providers and the development of new bodies to support local authorities with commissioning. With children’s social care currently being reviewed across the UK we want to see our recommendations reflected in any changes to policy.


The study looked at the provision of children’s social care in England, Scotland and Wales, across which there are over 100,000 looked-after children. The current annual cost for children’s social care services is around £5.7 billion in England, £680 million in Scotland and £350 million in Wales.

The CMA’s market study found that large private sector providers of fostering services and children homes appear to be making higher profits in England and Wales than the CMA would expect in a well-functioning market. This suggests that local authorities may be paying more for these services than they need to, particularly with fostering services, which are cheaper when run by local authorities.

The market study highlights and reflects the significant differences in the policy context for children’s social care between England, Scotland and Wales. The devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales have each committed to move away from the model of for-profit provision in children’s social care, and national organisations already exist in these nations to support local authorities. The recommendations the CMA makes will be relevant for each nation as they move through their own policy reform processes.

Notes to editors

Market studies, like this one, may lead to a range of outcomes, including recommendations to businesses in the market and to the government to change regulations or public policy.
  The children’s social care system is the subject of significant policy attention across the UK, including through the independent review of children’s social care in England, the implementation of the Promise review recommendations in Scotland and the Welsh Government’s Rebalancing care and support White Paper. The CMA’s recommendations will feed into ongoing policy reviews in the three nations in scope. In England, the CMA expects the recommendations to be considered as part of the ongoing Independent Review of Children’s Social Care, which is due to report this year. In Scotland and Wales, the CMA expects its recommendations to feed into the implementation of on-going reform proposals, including commitments to remove profit-making from the children’s social care sector.

22/03/2013,"How UK aid is working to eliminate and prevent all forms of violence against women and girls
","
    
          
This International Women’s Day we’re celebrating those working to end violence against girls and women.

South Africa Video

It is shocking and unacceptable that in the 21st century one in three women is beaten or sexually abused in her lifetime. Recent high profile stories including the protests in South East Asia over lack of justice for rape victims, and the story of Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban for campaigning for girls’ education have thrown a spotlight on the issue. These acts of violence are not going to stop unless action is taken to tackle the root causes of violence.

Violence against women and girls stops them getting an education, prevents them from being economically active and undermines their ability to choose the timing and number of children they want to have. It has a profound effect on the physical, social, emotional and psychological well-being of women and girls, and on their children and other dependents – it is a direct cause of death, disability and physical injury for victims and survivors. Due to its significant social and personal costs, sexual violence has and is being used as a weapon of war to destabilise populations, destroy bonds within communities and families and to humiliate ‘enemy’ women and men. It also has huge economic costs, including the direct costs to health, legal, police and other services.

At a UN meeting this month we have an opportunity to show the world that these acts of violence and brutalism will not be tolerated. This year’s theme for the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) – the global policy body for the advancement of women’s rights - is eliminating and preventing all forms of violence against women and girls. It is imperative that, unlike last year, there are agreed conclusions at CSW. A failure to do so will undermine progress made on women and girls’ rights and send out a signal that it is legitimate for these acts of violence to continue. The UK will be at the forefront of efforts to ensure that this does not happen and that a successful outcome is achieved at CSW.

31/07/2012,UK support helps poor children receive an education at low-cost private schools,"
    
          
Twelve-year-old Humza Iqbal has 4 brothers and 3 sisters. He lives in Lahore, Pakistan, with 11 of his family members sharing a small 1 room dwelling which has no roof and an uneven floor covered in rubble. Humza used to help his father sell fruit on the streets to earn a living but thanks to support from the UK he has been in school for nearly 2 years.

In Pakistan, more than 12 million children are not in school; half the adult population and two thirds of women can’t read or write. Pakistan is off track from achieving the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education by 2015. But education is 1 of the most important factors which can transform Pakistan’s future. It boosts the economy, broadens outlooks, and offers a brighter future for poor children like Humza who may otherwise be on the streets.

Part of the UK’s assistance is channeled through low-cost private schools. This sector has expanded rapidly in Punjab over the last few years. Fees are around £3 a month, which is less than half the price of putting a child through a public school. Low-cost private schools also offer smaller class sizes and better exam results.

Learning curve

Humza is the only member of his family who has ever been to school. ”I like school more than selling fruit,” he says. “I like the teachers, and have fun playing cricket and on the swing with my friends. My favourite subject is English and I want to become a teacher.

“Before I started school I used to walk around the streets or sell apples and oranges for my father. I couldn’t read or write. Now I’m learning. In our last test I came first in our class and was awarded a prize, my mum was very happy.”


Humza’s father selling fruits. Picture: Victoria Francis/ DFIDHis teacher says Humza is bright and catching up quickly. The support allows children who were roaming the streets the chance to go to school, giving them hope for the future, and the opportunity to lift themselves and their families out of abject poverty.

Humza’s mum, Barveen, explains: “Humza is my youngest. He has high hopes; he wants to be a teacher, I’m happy about that. Before he was roaming the streets and selling fruit. The voucher means he can go to school.”

Over the last few years UK support has helped millions of poor children go to school in Pakistan, provided them with textbooks, and built political and social pressure for change. UK development investment has:

supported some 420,000 children in school in 2010/11
  funded textbooks for all 4.4 million students and monthly stipends for more than 400,000 girls to help them go to school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 2009
  helped recruit 34,000 more teachers and supported improvements to the exam system in Punjab
By 2015, the UK will help:

support 4 million children in school
  recruit and train 45,000 teachers in Punjab
  construct more than 20,000 classrooms in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
  improve test results in core subjects including maths and English in Punjab
  build 12,000 literacy centres to teach women in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to read and write

28/01/2016,Development of accessible and relevant library services to families with disabled children,"
    
          
West Sussex Library Service works with colleagues from the Special Educational Needs & Disability (SEND) team to develop accessible and relevant library services to families with disabled children (e.g. sensory storytimes).

Contribution to corporate priorities

Start of life: early intervention to provide targeted support where necessary

Later life: providing support for older people (and those providing care for them) to enable them to live independently for longer

Helping people to help themselves: empowering residents to access services that enable them to solve their own problems

The right people, delivering the right service, at the right cost – designing service which are cost effective, avoid duplication and are accessible by residents who need them

Description of the work and the partnership

West Sussex Library Service is working with colleagues from the Special Educational Needs & Disability (SEND) team.

From this partnership a need was identified for families wanting access to low-tech communication aids to support children and young people with limited or no speech.

After some initial scoping it was proposed that the library service be commissioned by the SEND team to establish a special communication library. The commissioning agreement required the library service to:

establish a working group of relevant professionals and parent carers to design the new service
  purchase communication aids as identified by professionals and parent carers, and service them as library stock to enable them to be loaned out
  create an online catalogue and request process to enable customers across West Sussex to view the collection and obtain an item via their local library
  promote the new service via all channels, including children’s librarians undertaking community-based outreach work
  monitor usage and provide feedback to SEND team to inform future service planning and provision
Outcomes achieved

Understand Me - the communication library went live to the public with 30 items at the end of October 2015. Since then every item in the collection has been borrowed at least once, with most items loaned several times. More items have been added to the collection to meet demand for certain devices. Customers accessing the service have included parent carers, speech and language therapists working with children and adults, teachers and preschool staff.

Accomplishments / lessons learnt

The team has collated feedback from customers as they use the service. This information is to help monitor use, plan to meet future demand and also build a business case for financial support from the local NHS. Monitoring usage has meant they have been able to make informed decisions about how to expand the collection based on what people are requesting and using most. However, some customers have suggested such monitoring seems intrusive and that they need to provide clearer explanations on the webpage, as to why information is being asked about the end user.

Future plans

West Sussex are now working with professionals supporting adults with communication difficulties to extend the scope of the service. They plan to develop the collection to include devices that support adults with dementia, acquired brain injuries or learning disabilities. They are also in discussion with local NHS colleagues to explore future commissioning options.

04/09/2020,Demonstration of collision avoidance system sees 2 vehicles steer around stationary car without human assistance.,"
    
          
A UK government-backed consortium has achieved a ‘world first’ by demonstrating a collision-avoidance system in which 2 vehicles co-operate by radio link to steer around a stationary car without human assistance.

The successful live demo at Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground in Leicestershire is a significant milestone in developing a driver aid to avoid multi-vehicle collisions, particularly motorway pile-ups.

It was the climax of a 32-month project called MuCCA (Multi-Car Collision Avoidance), led by Applus IDIADA and involving 5 other automotive industry, technology and research partners. This £4.6 million project was jointly funded by the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV) and delivered through Innovate UK.

There were 1,870 road deaths in the UK to June 2019 and human error is a factor in 95% of accidents.

Acting autonomously, vehicles equipped with MuCCA technology figure out between them what to do when confronted with an obstacle or a likely collision. If an accident is unavoidable, the MuCCA system will intervene to minimise injuries and damage. In normal traffic, the technology could help to reduce the bunching and congestion on motorways which is costly to the UK economy.

MuCCA incorporates 3 key elements:

sensing of the immediate environment around the vehicle
  automatic steering as well as automatic braking
  live vehicle-to-vehicle radio messaging, communicating 50 times a second
The autonomous vehicles cooperate in real-time – something humans cannot do – and can manoeuvre to give another car the space to avoid an obstacle. With sophisticated machine learning algorithms developed at Cranfield University, MuCCA can even predict how non-autonomous vehicles with human drivers are likely to react. The next stage of development will focus on refining the control systems and extending simulation testing to more tricky scenarios and higher speeds.

25/01/2021,Over £23 million funding allocated to 60 councils and voluntary groups across England to expand work to support those most at risk from COVID-19 and boost vaccine take up.,"
    
          


    £23.75 million funding for councils and voluntary groups to expand covid communications with at risk groups
  
  
    Community Champions will share COVID-19 vaccine advice and information to boost local vaccination take-up
  
  
    Funding will support extra school programmes, helplines and phone calls to those in at risk groups
  


Over £23 million funding has been allocated to 60 councils and voluntary groups across England to expand work to support those most at risk from COVID-19 and boost vaccine take up, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick announced today (25 January 2021).

Through the Community Champions scheme councils and voluntary organisations will deliver a wide range of measures to protect those most at risk - building trust, communicating accurate health information and ultimately helping to save lives. This will include developing new networks of trusted local champions where they don’t already exist.

Today’s funding is specifically targeted at areas with plans to reach groups such as older people, disabled people, and people from ethnic minority backgrounds who according to the latest evidence are more likely to suffer long-term impacts and poor outcomes from COVID-19. Each of the 60 councils have developed their own plan to improve communications with these groups including helplines, school programmes, workplace engagement, phoning those in at risk groups as well as training sessions to help people provide information and advice.

The Community Champions will tap into their local networks to provide advice about COVID-19 and the vaccines. Champions will also work with councils to identify barriers to accessing accurate information and to provide tailored support, such as phone calls for people who are digitally excluded, helplines, and linking to GP surgeries.

The funding will also support areas to tackle misinformation and encourage take-up as the vaccination programme expands across the country.

This builds on wider, cross-government measures to engage communities to tackle the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on certain groups and to provide accurate information about COVID -19 and the vaccines to everyone.

This is part of over £7.9 billion government funding provided to councils to help them support their communities during the pandemic.

Communities Secretary, Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  It is vital that everyone has access to accurate and up to date information about COVID-19. False information about COVID-19 vaccines could cost lives. Today’s funding will help councils and community groups expand some of the excellent work already underway and reach out to their communities to ensure they have the information they need and get their questions answered. Ultimately this funding will help save lives.


Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock said:


  Throughout the pandemic, our priority has been to protect the most vulnerable.



  It is vital higher-risk groups are able to access the advice and information they need whether it’s about testing, accessing the NHS or the benefits of a lifesaving vaccine.



  I’m delighted to see further funding going to local areas to support their communities during this challenging time, and I’m thankful for the continued expertise and dedication of community leaders in spreading the word about our historic vaccination rollout programme across the country.


Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi said:


  We want all communities to take up the offer of a free vaccine and I have been working closely with faith and community leaders to ensure those who may be at higher risk of harm from this virus know how they can benefit from a vaccine.



  The expansion of the Community Champions scheme will help everyone get the advice and information they need about COVID-19 vaccines.


Community Champions are already in place across many areas of England, and in Birmingham have proved effective in helping communities understand what they need to do to stay safe.

Cllr Paulette Hamilton, Cabinet Member for Health and Social Care, said:


  We’ve seen great success in Birmingham with our community champions network with it helping us reach identified gaps and those sometimes harder to reach communities across the city.



  Champions are supported through regular live Q&A sessions allowing them to gain access to the latest advice and guidance that is accessible to those with various disabilities and language barriers to share amongst our communities.



  We also provide the opportunity for them to share their insights and concerns and encourage and welcome two-way communications to help inform local strategy and delivery.


Throughout the pandemic, the government has prioritised protecting the most vulnerable in our society and have invested more than £4 million into research on ethnic disparities in COVID-19, so that we can go further.

Many different communities will be supported, including Gypsy, Roma, Traveller, people with learning disabilities, as well as faith groups. Champions will be drawn from these groups to share accurate health information with their neighbours, networks, and wider community.

Two charities, Strengthening Faith Institutions and Near Neighbours, will be supporting councils in working with grassroot organisations and community leaders, to ensure that communities understand how the pandemic is being tackled and feel empowered to take action to keep themselves safe.

Birmingham case study

Debbie, aged 52 from Birmingham:


  I became a Champion because I’m a childminder.  I felt that by being a Champion I could lead by example and ensure that I pass accurate and up-to-date information to other childminders and to the families of the children I care for. I do feel that by following the proper government advice sent through the Community Champion scheme, and with the precautions my work setting put in place, the effect of COVID-19 here has been limited.



  I also have two children, both in fulltime education: one at secondary school, the other at college. My husband is also in the vulnerable person category as he has Multiple Sclerosis. So, as well as working, I must support the family, looking after two boys who are studying from home.



  By no means has our time been easy. My father passed away in February and my father-in-law in October. Fortunately, neither were COVID-19-related but organising funerals with restrictions was difficult.



  As a Champion I send all the updates from the council to a local support group on WhatsApp, which includes everyone in our cul-de-sac. Anyone can also pop on there what they need shopping-wise and we go and get it for them. In fact, my weekly grocery delivery includes three other vulnerable households, as well as my own. So, we wipe everything down, pop it in bags, and deliver the shopping on the doorstep in what looks like a glorified version of ‘knock-door-run’!



  I’m a member of the Birmingham City Council Early Years COVID-19 group, where we try and support all early-years settings. Here the council has even provided us with PPE, which I have collected to deliver to a number of locations. They have also signposted us to mobile units where we can have lateral flow tests in the hope that parents see that our childcare settings are safe.



  I cannot express how great Birmingham City Council has been with latest updates, government advice and much more.

02/12/2021,"The CMA Chair, Jonathan Scott, says “competition will be more important than ever before” in the year ahead, as the organisation consults on its Annual Plan.","
    
          The draft Annual Plan explains how the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will protect consumers, promote competition and help support the economy. It aims to encourage innovation, productivity, and sustainable growth to benefit all nations and regions of the UK.

The consultation sets out 5 themes on which the CMA proposes to focus in 2022 to 2023:


    Protecting consumers from unfair behaviour by businesses, during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic
  
  
    Fostering competition to promote innovation, productivity and long-term growth right across the UK
  
  
    Promoting effective competition in digital markets
  
  
    Supporting the transition to low carbon growth, including through the development of healthy competitive markets in sustainable products and services
  
  
    Delivering the CMA’s new responsibilities and strengthening its position as a global competition and consumer protection authority.
  
Jonathan Scott, Chair of the CMA, said:


  The emergence of the Omicron strain has added to the uncertainty being felt by consumers and businesses about the impact of coronavirus. In the run-up to Christmas we remain vigilant in protecting people across the UK from unfair behaviour and working to ensure their rights are protected.

  As we look to the future, and as the UK emerges from the worst effects of the pandemic, healthy competition will be more important than ever before. Competitive markets are essential to economic recovery because they create the conditions for investment and long-term growth in the UK. They drive innovation, increase productivity and create the best conditions to create sustainable jobs. What’s more, when markets aren’t competitive, prices go up, quality drops and the cost of living rises, hitting less well-off households the hardest.

  We’re keen to hear a wide range of voices on our plan for promoting competition and delivering in the interests of people and businesses around the UK in the coming year.


In 2022 to 2023, the CMA will develop and embed the significant new responsibilities that have been conferred on it, including the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) and the Office for the Internal Market (OIM). It will also help shape the UK’s future subsidy control regime by preparing for the creation of the Subsidy Advice Unit (SAU).

The CMA will expand its presence in the UK’s nations and regions, recruiting more staff in its offices in Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh and opening new ones in Darlington and Manchester.

The CMA plans to make the most of these new functions and the opportunities they bring to secure good outcomes for people throughout the UK, while playing a bigger role internationally to promote competition and protect consumers.

In 2022 to 2023, it will also do more to develop a deeper understanding of the issues people face, in particular those who are vulnerable. It will do more to explain its decision-making processes and commits to being an increasingly visible and vocal advocate for consumers.

The CMA’s consultation is intended to give partners, interested parties and members of the public the opportunity to provide views and comments on the CMA’s proposed Annual Plan for 2022 to 2023, and welcomes all feedback and suggestions.

For more information on the Annual Plan and how to share your views with the CMA, please visit the Annual Plan consultation page.

27/09/2019,"Following an investigation by the Environment Agency (EA), one of the UK’s largest waste management companies - Biffa Waste Services Ltd - has been ordered to pay a total of £599,912 for breaching waste exports regulations.","
    
          
In June, Biffa was found guilty after a three week trial of sending contaminated household waste, described as waste paper, to China between May and June 2015. Exports of unsorted household recycling waste from the UK to China are banned.

During the EA investigation, officers prevented seven 25-tonne containers destined for China at Felixstowe Port from onward export. Although marked as waste paper, the contents of the containers included soiled nappies, food packaging, items of clothing, bags of faeces, wood, tin cans, plastic bottles and electric cable.

In a hearing held today at Wood Green Crown Court  the court heard brief details about four further charges against Biffa illegally exporting 42 containers of waste collected from households to India and Indonesia between November 2018 and February 2019.

The court fined Biffa £350,000 and ordered that the company pays costs of £240,000 and a further £9,912 under the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA).

The EA has introduced a number of additional measures to tackle illegal exports including working closely with HMRC reviewing inconsistencies between customs information and packaging data, and creating an investigations team to target serious offenders.

Malcolm Lythgo, Head of Waste at the Environment Agency, said:

“We are pleased with the court’s decision. We want all producers and exporters of waste to be responsible and make sure they only export material that can be legally and safely exported for recycling overseas.

“Illegal waste export blights the lives and environment of those overseas. We continue to treat illegal waste exports as a priority and will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against those found to break the rules.

“Between 2018 and 2019, we prevented the illegal export of 12,690 tonnes of unsuitable waste and are working with the government on a number of measures to tighten controls including increasing monitoring of international waste shipments and charging higher fees to improve compliance.”

During the trial, jurors heard how Biffa used two brokers to arrange the export to two paper mills in Shenzhen and Guang Dong, a coastal province of southeast China. The jury did  not accept Biffa’s version of events that consignments leaving its depot in Edmonton four years ago complied with the law because they comprised of waste paper. The first broker took up a request from a Chinese client in April 2015 to arrange shipment of 5,863 tonnes of mixed waste paper from Biffa. A price of around £350,000 was agreed for this order. At the same time, Biffa agreed with a second broker to ship 4,992 tonnes of mixed paper in a contract worth almost £290,000.  The seven stopped containers were part of these two orders.

All UK waste exports must be in accordance with Waste Shipments Regulation and the EA have a system of inspections in place to verify compliance.  This will remain the case post-Brexit.

The Government’s Resources and Waste strategy puts forward a suite of measures including: extended producer responsibility (EPR) for packaging waste; a consistent set of materials to be collected for recycling by local authorities; a deposit return scheme (DRS) for beverage containers; and a ‘plastics tax’ on packaging containing less than 30 per cent recycled plastic.

27/06/2019,All new-build houses will be sold as freehold in bold move to tackle unfair leasehold practices.,"
    
          

Pernicious ground-rents on new leases to be reduced to £0 – preventing leaseholders being charged soaring fees for which they receive zero benefit
  All new houses to be sold on freehold basis unless there are exceptional circumstances – ending unscrupulous practice of unnecessary leaseholds
  Immediate action to ban Help to Buy being used to support leasehold houses – stopping taxpayers’ money being used to fund unjustified sale of leasehold houses


All new-build houses will be sold as freehold in a bold move to tackle unfair leasehold practices and prevent future home-owners from being trapped in exploitative arrangements, the Communities Secretary said today (27 June 2019).

In a wide-ranging speech to the Chartered Institute of Housing conference in Manchester, the Rt Hon James Brokenshire MP confirmed plans to abolish the selling of new houses as leasehold properties and reduce ground rents for new leases to zero – putting cash back into the pockets of future homeowners.

To stop freeholders and managing agents taking as long as they want – and charging what they want - to provide leaseholders with the vital information they need to sell their home, ministers will introduce a new time limit of 15 working days and a maximum fee of £200 to make the home buying process quicker, easier and cheaper.

The Secretary of State has also instructed Homes England to renegotiate Help to Buy contracts to explicitly rule out the selling of new leasehold houses, other than in exceptional circumstances, to protect new home buyers from unscrupulous charges.

And where buyers are incorrectly sold a leasehold home – saddling them with a property that could ultimately prove difficult to sell – consumers will be able to get their freehold outright at no extra cost.

The measures announced today demonstrate the government’s commitment to ensure decent and fair housing for the people and communities that need them, as it strives to deliver 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s.

Other important proposals unveiled include new proposals to make it easier for renters to transfer deposits directly between landlords when moving; extra funding for 19 new garden villages; and radical new measures to speed up planning applications.

Communities Secretary Rt Hon James Brokenshire MP told the Chartered Institute of Housing conference:


  We have long recognised that we have a responsibility to confront unfairness in the leasehold market. Last year we consulted on proposals including the leasehold house ban and ground rent reduction.

  Today I can confirm we will go ahead with our original plan to reduce ground rents on future leases to zero, as opposed to a cap of £10 per year.

  And we will legislate to ensure that in the future – save for the most exceptional circumstances – all new house will be sold on a freehold basis.

  We are committed to taking bold action to reform the sector and will be pressing ahead as soon as parliamentary time allows – helping us delivery our promise to make the home buying and selling process quicker, cheaper and easier.


The government’s proposals have already had a fundamental impact on the housing market since they were unveiled, with the sale of leasehold houses falling from 11% to just 2% this year.

Plans for deposit passporting

More than 4 million people live in the private rented sector, yet when moving home, some tenants can find it a struggle to provide a second deposit to their new landlord – risking falling into debt or becoming trapped in their current home. Ministers want to understand the scale of this problem.

Ministers are inviting proposals to make it easier for renters to transfer deposits directly between landlords when moving from one property to the next.

Freeing up deposits and allowing a renter’s hard-earned cash to follow them from property to property – as they move to take that perfect job, to move nearer to family, or find a place that suits their changing needs – will create a fairer housing market that works for all.

New garden communities to be created

An extra 
  19 garden villages  (PDF, 110 KB, 1 page) will be created across the country, with the potential to deliver 73,554 homes, it has been announced today.

The government is providing £2.85 million to support the development of plans for housing from County Durham in the North to Truro in the South West.

Each of the projects will be given £150,000 to progress planning applications and specialist reports needed before homes are built.

The new settlements include a dementia-friendly community village at St George’s Barracks, in Rutland, which would allow the elderly to live safely and independently in their own homes.

Planning bureaucracy cut

Councils will be able to approve planning applications more quickly under radical new measures to remove bureaucracy from the system.

The new accelerated planning green paper, to be published later this year, will dramatically improve the planning process.

This is part of a renewed and refreshed focus on making sure planning authorities have the resources they need to act for the benefit of homeowners – delivering a better service, faster than ever before. 

Leasehold changes

New measures will also be taken to prevent developers selling leasehold houses through the Help to Buy Scheme - preventing taxpayers’ money from directly supporting the unjustified sale of leasehold houses. 

The Communities Secretary has today instructed Homes England to renegotiate contracts with all Help to Buy developers to explicitly rule out the building and selling of leasehold houses, other than in exceptional circumstances.

This all comes as a further 18 leading property developers, managing agents and freeholders – including Crest Nicolson and Keepmoat Homes – have signed up to the government’s industry pledge, committing them to freeing existing leaseholders trapped in onerous deals where ground rents double every 10 or 15 years. This takes the total number of signatories to over 60.

New Homes Ombudsman

The government wants to see more good quality homes that people are proud to buy and proud to live in – and a New Homes Ombudsman, will protect the rights of homebuyers and hold developers to account.

Today ministers have launched a consultation on redress for purchasers of new build homes and the New Homes Ombudsman. This seeks views on the detail of the proposed legislation and how a new homes ombudsman can be delivered and will run until August 22.

They are also exploring the options to appoint a New Homes Ombudsman in shadow form – someone to work closely with industry, consumer groups and government to ensure improvements and standards are delivered quickly and help shape the future scheme.

£2 billion long-term affordable homes funding

The Communities Secretary opened the bidding process for £2 billion in long term strategic partnerships to deliver additional affordable homes with funding available until March 2029.

This marks the first time any government has invested such long-term funding in new affordable homes through Housing Associations, supporting the development of more ambitious long-term plans to build the homes this country needs.

These new bids will continue to build on the over 430,000 affordable homes delivered since 2010.

10/08/2020,A new government package worth £172 million will help to train thousands more nursing degree apprentices.,"
    
          Nursing careers made more accessible through ‘earn and learn’ route
  Up to 2,000 nursing apprentices to be trained every year for the next 4 years
Nursing careers in England will be made more accessible through a new government package worth up to £172 million, which will enable healthcare employers to take on up to 2,000 nursing degree apprentices every year over the next 4 years.

The news comes as interest in health careers has surged, with the number of people looking for information on nursing on the NHS careers website rising by 138% between March and June.

Nursing degree apprenticeships provide a route into nursing where people can train to nationally recognised standards and earn as they learn, benefiting those for whom a full-time university course is not practical or preferred.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:


  I’m thrilled to see a rising interest in nursing careers, but we must ensure this fantastic career is truly diverse and open to all.

  Nursing apprenticeships allow students to earn as they learn and this new funding will enable healthcare employers to hire thousands more, helping us to deliver 50,000 more nurses by the end of this Parliament.


Gillian Keegan, Apprenticeships and Skills Minister said:


  Nursing apprenticeships are a brilliant way to start a truly rewarding career with our fantastic NHS.  Nurses are at the heart of our NHS and their care, compassion and support of patients save and transform lives across the country every day.

  This multi-million pound funding boost will help to support thousands of apprentices to gain the skills they need, and earn while they learn. Apprenticeships are an excellent way for anyone, regardless of their background, to kick start their career or to progress.


NHS and other healthcare employers will receive £8,300 per placement per year for both new and existing apprenticeships. Nursing degree apprentices already receive a salary and have their tuition costs paid for through the apprenticeship programme. The funding will enable employers to meet the costs of taking on apprentices, including staffing costs while apprentices are undertaking education and training.

The nursing degree apprenticeship is a 4-year course with placements available in the 4 fields of adult, children, mental health and learning disability, after which students can qualify as fully registered nurses. NHS and social care employers currently train around 1,000 nurse apprentices every year.

In addition to this funding, employers in England will also benefit from a new payment announced last month of £2,000 for each new apprentice they hire aged under 25, and £1,500 for each new apprentice they hire aged 25 and over, up until 31 January 2021.

The news comes the week after the NHS People Plan was published setting out how the NHS will put staff wellbeing at its heart with a new recruitment, retention and support package. It sets out practical support for wellbeing such as safe spaces to rest and recuperate, wellbeing guardians and support to keep staff physically safe and healthy.

Case studies

Adam Cramp, 29, completed a Nursing Degree Apprenticeship at Broadmoor Hospital, part of West London NHS Trust, said:


  This scheme has given me an opportunity that I would never have thought possible. I left school without any A-Levels and worked in retail, security and as a healthcare assistant, where I realised I wanted to support patients and I am now a registered nurse.

  Without this apprenticeship, I would not have been able to get the qualifications I needed due to barriers in attending university, especially as a mature student but now believe that this is the best route into a nursing career regardless of your personal situation.

  The support I’ve received from my trust, my university and my managers is incredible and I even won the Apprentice of the Year Award in 2018. I encourage anybody interested to apply, I’m so thankful that I did.


Sophie Hurcombe, 31, a second-year Nursing Degree Apprentice from South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Trust, said:


  I joined the trust as a healthcare assistant in 2015 and witnessed first-hand the fantastic opportunities and job satisfaction that my qualified nurse colleagues had. When I saw that the trust was advertising nursing apprenticeships, I knew that this would be an amazing opportunity to progress my career.

  As a more mature student, full-time university was not financially realistic for me, so being able to study alongside my role as a healthcare assistant has allowed me to develop my skills and confidence whilst earning a wage.

  The support I have received from colleagues has been invaluable and I would recommend a nursing apprenticeship to anyone thinking about getting their foot on the NHS career ladder.


Dennis Little, Head of Workforce Development and Education at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Trust, said:


  We introduced the Registered Nurse Degree Apprenticeship to allow experienced healthcare professionals at our trust to train as registered nurses at the University of Sunderland. The programme has allowed our apprentices to utilise the knowledge and experience they have gained through providing high-quality patient care in their nurse training.

  Apprenticeships are a great opportunity for people to develop, who may find it difficult to pursue a traditional university route towards nursing, but demonstrate a natural ability to deliver compassionate care to our patients.

  We are proud to support our current apprentices and look forward to further developing our skilled nursing workforce in the future.


Becky White, 30, a Nursing Degree Apprentice from West London NHS Trust. said:


  I have always wanted to support others with their mental health, and my interest in this grew, working on the rehabilitation wards at Broadmoor Hospital. When they began offering nursing degree apprenticeships, I realised this was the perfect opportunity to develop my career and become a successful mental health nurse.

  I now split my time between gaining further on-the-job experience, university, and placements. My role is incredibly varied, and I’m delighted to be in a position where I can achieve and encourage others towards, success.


Background information

The nursing degree apprenticeship funding will be made available at the start of this academic year 2020 to 2021 for existing apprentices or when the apprentice starts their placement with the employer.

The additional apprenticeship funding was announced on 8 July as part of HMT’s ‘A Plan for Jobs 2020’. The payments will be in addition to the existing £1,000 payment the government already provides for new 16 to 18 year-old apprentices, and those aged under 25 with an Education, Health and Care Plan – where that applies.

Details on ‘A Plan for Jobs’ additional funding for employers of apprentices under the age of 25 is available on GOV.UK.

03/09/2020,"Lab capacity to continue to increase ahead of winter, with a new Lighthouse Lab set to open near Loughborough by the end of September.","
    
          
    NHS Test and Trace continues to reach the majority of those testing positive and their contacts in week 13 of operation
  
  
    Brand new large-scale technology to increase the number of tests that NHS and Lighthouse Labs can process is being introduced
  
A new Lighthouse Lab near Loughborough will join Britain’s largest network of diagnostic testing facilities in history to increase coronavirus testing capacity.

The new lab will be brought into the lab network this month and will be able to process around 50,000 tests per day by the end of the year.

This comes as the weekly statistics from NHS Test and Trace show that the service continues to reach the majority of those testing positive and their contacts, in week 13 reaching 80% of contacts where contact information was available.

Demand for testing continues to rise, with those tested for the first time increasing by 63% since mid-June.

The new lab is part of plans to scale up testing capacity to 500,000 swab tests per day by the end October. There is currently capacity for 350,000 tests each day in the UK, across all 4 testing pillars including antibody tests and surveillance studies. The growth in demand means that existing capacity for pillar 2 swab tests is being fully utilised and in line with existing plans, the capacity is being quickly expanded.

Alongside increased Lighthouse Lab capacity, brand new large-scale processing units are being rolled out for use across both NHS and Lighthouse Labs.

Today £500 million has been announced to increase capacity and roll out new cutting-edge testing technology to deliver rapid tests. Chains of transmission will be broken almost immediately by delivering on-the-spot results. Successful trials will then be expanded and rolled out further, with new tests being used in Salford, Southampton and Hampshire over the coming weeks.

NHS Test and Trace continues to focus efforts to uplift testing by working closely with local authorities and communities where there is high prevalence of the virus.

Interim Executive Chair of the National Institute for Public Health, Baroness Dido Harding, said:


  NHS Test and Trace has been operating for more than 3 months and during that time it has consistently reached the majority of those testing positive and their contacts, almost 330,000 people at risk of unknowingly passing the virus on.

  As the service has become part of our everyday lives, demand for testing has increased. To meet this, we continue our efforts to build and scale testing capacity to reach 500,000 tests per day by the end of October by making use of new tests, new labs and new technology.

  Thanks to all the people who have come forward for a free test, and the vital work of local teams around the country making sure people are aware of testing we are breaking chains of transmission. The advice remains the same: if you have symptoms of coronavirus get tested and if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace, follow the advice you receive.


From this week, the new equipment which will boost processing capacity for each lab beyond 100,000 tests a day will be trialled in the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab. The technology will allow labs to process a higher number of test samples simultaneously, reduce costs, and will be able to process saliva-based tests being piloted in Southampton and Salford announced today.

Increased lab capacity across the country will help to further improve test turnaround times while meeting additional demand, with this week’s NHS Test and Trace statistics showing that  84.3% of in-person test results already being returned the day after a test was taken. The median average time it takes for a test result to be returned from a drive-through or walk-through test site is now only 24 hours, or 22 hours at a mobile testing unit.

Since launching in May, the service has reached almost 330,000 people at risk of unknowingly passing the virus on, significantly curbing the spread of coronavirus in England.

These figures demonstrate that NHS Test and Trace continues to perform well against international contact tracing standards.

Statistics from the 13th week of operation of NHS Test and Trace (20 to 26 August) show that since the service launched:


    327,927 people have been reached by the service. This includes both those testing positive and their contacts
  
  
    79.7% of all contacts identified were reached, which increases to 87.7% for those we had contact information for
  
  
    78.5% of people testing positive and transferred to the contact tracing system were reached since launch
  
  
    4,833,347 people have been newly tested under pillars 1 and 2
  
In the latest week (20 to 26 August):


    81.4% of people testing positive and transferred to the contact tracing system were reached
  
  
    80.0% of contacts we had information for were reached
  
  
    452,679 people have been newly tested under pillars 1 and 2
  
Background information

New testing technology is being supplied by LGC to Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab. Each LGC machine is able to process up to 150,000 tests per day, at reduced cost and speed.

Thousands more homes to be made available for vulnerable rough sleepers
  Commitment is unprecedented and most ambitious of its kind with single biggest injection of specialist accommodation since the Rough Sleeping Initiative began
  It will be backed by £433 million of government funding with 3,300 homes to be made available in next 12 months
  Dame Louise Casey highlights ’extraordinary opportunity’ to end rough sleeping for good


Radical plans to provide thousands of long-term, safe homes for vulnerable rough sleepers taken off the streets during the pandemic have been unveiled today (24 May 2020) by Housing Secretary Robert  Jenrick MP.

This ambitious commitment – the biggest of its kind since the government’s Rough Sleeping Initiative began – will be backed by £160 million this year and will support many of the thousands of rough sleepers currently housed in emergency accommodation to move on to more sustainable, long-term housing.

By accelerating plans for the £381 million announced for rough sleeping services at Budget – now extended to £433 million – the funding will ensure that 6,000 new housing units will be put into the system, with 3,300 of these becoming available in the next 12 months.  

In addition to accelerating this capital spend for investment in housing stock, the government is also increasing the revenue support of the total programme by 37% to make sure that the rough sleepers have the support they need to stay off the streets for good.

Once in their new home, rough sleepers will be supported by specialist staff to access the help they need, such as support for mental health or substance abuse problems, so they can rebuild their lives, move towards training and work, and remain off the streets for good. 

Thanks to the efforts of charities, local government and other partners, in just over 2 months, more than 90% of rough sleepers known to councils at the beginning of the pandemic have now been offered accommodation where they can remain safe and able to protect themselves during the crisis.

The plans are being pulled together by the Rough Sleeping COVID-19 Response Taskforce, led by Dame Louise Casey, bringing together local government, charities, faith groups, public sector partners and businesses in order to use the coronavirus crisis and current successful work so far in bringing ‘everyone in’ as a catalyst towards ending rough sleeping for good.

As part of this commitment, Homes England, in partnership with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) has pledged to work hand-in-hand with leading housing associations and local authorities to fast-track thousands of units of longer-term accommodation for rough sleepers needed now.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP said:


  We have offered accommodation to over 90% of known rough sleepers in order to help them stay safe during the pandemic. This has been possible because of an incredible effort by the government, councils and charities. Thousands of lives have been protected as a result of the shared commitment to protect the most vulnerable in our society throughout this national emergency and we continue to fund this vital project.   

  This government wants to end rough sleeping for good, and we now have a real opportunity to deliver on this moral mission. I’m backing this effort with £433 million to fast-track the longer-term and safe accommodation needed to ensure as few rough sleepers as possible return to the streets.

  This is an unprecedented commitment – the most ambitious of its kind and the single biggest injection of specialist accommodation since the rough sleepers initiative began. 

  This will be completely transformative and changes the lives of thousands of rough sleepers for the better.


Dame Louise Casey said:  


  The goal is ambitious – together, we want to do everything possible to ensure that vulnerable people who were sleeping rough and have come inside during this pandemic – some for the first time in a very long time – do not go back to the streets.

  The effort so far has been immense – councils, charities and health providers have all worked tirelessly to support some of the most vulnerable during these unprecedented times. I want to thank all of those who have already stepped up to support rough sleepers so far and those who are pledging accommodation and future support.

  We know this safe harbour is just the start – we have here an extraordinary opportunity to end rough sleeping for good.


Nick Walkley, CEO Homes England said:


  The steps taken to reduce homelessness have been one of the few silver linings in recent months. The opportunity to work with Dame Louise Casey to build on these recent successes and work towards ending rough sleeping for good is something everyone at Homes England is supportive of. We look forward to working closely with MHCLG and our partners to support the Taskforce.


Over the coming weeks, government will work in partnership with councils, local leaders and the property sector to ensure this new generation of housing for some of the most vulnerable in society is delivered as quickly as possible and in the most cost-effective way.

Interim accommodation is also being committed by the YHA, the YMCA and some universities. The taskforce will continue to work with partners on this so that nobody has to go back to the streets.

Ministers have also announced a further £6 million for frontline homeless charities to directly support their important, vital work.  In addition, the Department for Education will be providing more than £700,000 for councils to support care leavers at risk of homelessness and rough sleeping.

12/09/2019,Includes projects aimed at improving online housing repairs services and making websites for planning applications easier to use.,"
    
          More than £750,000 has been awarded to councils looking to improve services using digital technology, Local Government Minister Luke Hall MP has announced (12 September 2019).

Six projects by local authorities working together across the country have received £753,000 from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government’s Local Digital Fund.

They include projects aimed at improving online housing repairs services, making websites for planning applications easier to use, and giving residents smoother methods of online payment.

Minister for Local Government, Luke Hall MP, said:


  Councils up and down the country are working together to embrace digital technology and improve public services.

  They are truly looking ahead and adapting their work to make things better for residents. I’m delighted to invest over £750,000 from our Local Digital Fund into 6 more collaborative projects aimed at improving local services.


Projects funded and the local authorities involved are:

Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council (lead), Leeds City Council, and Manchester City Council - £350,000.

Providing social workers with better information to cut the time and cost of child referrals. A project to provide social workers with better family context information from other local services for their child referrals. It will speed up children’s social workers’ decision making, improving the experience of families, and saving money.

Buckinghamshire County Council (lead), Adur and Worthing Council, London Borough of Croydon and Leeds City Council - £50,000.

Prototyping an open community directory of support services. The project will be aimed at developing a community-based service directory in local areas to help residents and council officers know which support services are available locally. This includes both council and third-sector provided support services.

London Borough of Southwark (lead), London Borough of Hackney, Greater London Authority, and Surrey Heath Borough Council - £100,000.

Exploring how to make the planning process more efficient and transparent. The project will look at user-centred digital planning application systems.

City of Lincoln Council, London Borough of Southwark, South Kesteven District and Royal Borough of Greenwich - £100,000

Developing a better online housing repairs system. A project to explore and prototype common service patterns for reporting and managing repairs.

Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council (lead), Allerdale Borough Council, Cherwell District Council, Huntingdon District Council, North East Lincolnshire District Council, Sheffield City Council and South Northamptonshire Council - £80,000.

Exploring income management and e-payments. A project to help councils overcome blockages to adopting existing cost-effective payment and management systems and move away from legacy systems and suppliers.

Worcestershire County Council (lead), Redditch and Bromsgrove Council and Suffolk County Council - £73,000.

Providing registrations data to local authority housing services. A project to use death registration data to reconcile the availability of social housing, reduce the wait time for families on local housing lists and prevent lost council tax revenue.

This funding round was only open to projects which were previously awarded funding last year. A funding round remains open for new local authority projects to apply to the Local Digital Fund before it closes on 16 September.

Ideas could range from making people’s lives easier with more efficient, online ways to pay for services or get help, to embracing tech to support vulnerable people or making bin collections, social housing repairs and taxi licensing services more efficient.

For the projects, lead councils across the country partner with at least 2 other councils to share knowledge and ideas. This collaborative approach is a key pillar of the government’s Local Digital Declaration, launched in 2018, to coordinate public bodies seeking digital solutions

The Fund is also being invested in digital skills and digital leadership training for council staff.

15/07/2019,The government has started a consultation to transform support for sick and disabled staff and remove barriers for employers.,"
    
          Today (Monday 15 July) Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Health Secretary Matt Hancock are setting out new measures to transform how employers support and retain disabled staff and those with a health condition.

Under the new measures the lowest paid employees would be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay for the first time, while small businesses may be offered a sick pay rebate to reward those who effectively manage employees on sick leave and help them get back to work.

Each year more than 100,000 people leave their job following a period of sickness absence lasting at least 4 weeks, new figures show.

The longer somebody is on sickness absence the more likely they are to fall out of work, with 44% of people who had been off sick for a year then leaving employment altogether.

Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said:


  I want Britain to be an environment where disabled people and those with health conditions can thrive, not just survive – not only in work but every area of their lives.

  With 3 in 5 employers facing challenges when supporting employees to return to work, it’s time that we took a closer look at how businesses can retain staff.

  Good work is good for our mental and physical health, and by working closely with employers we can help prevent the loss of talent when people unnecessarily leave the workplace.


Businesses and health providers will be asked for their views on how to remove the barriers in the current system which stop employers from taking action, with small employers expected to need the most support.

The majority of small employers reported a lack of time and capital to invest in support as the key issues.

The government will also consider whether to change legal guidance to encourage employers to intervene early during a period of sickness absence.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:


  Too many still face challenges returning to work after sick leave. We need to remove the barriers that stop people with disabilities or health conditions from reaching their full potential – these steps will help us achieve that.

  Businesses will also benefit from being able to retain talent, and build workplaces that support the physical and mental health needs of their employees.


While government can help create the right conditions, employers are best placed to take the small actions that help disabled people and those with health conditions to remain in work.

Evidence shows that early intervention by an employer is important in reducing the number of people leaving the workforce for health reasons. Employers can use simple, low-cost measures such as making flexible adjustments to someone’s working pattern or keeping in touch with people while they are on sick leave.

CBI Chief UK Policy Director Matthew Fell said:


  Managing sickness absence effectively and reducing it through proactive health and wellbeing initiatives and policies makes good business sense. Where this helps disabled people to contribute their best at work it can also be an important part of employers’ diversity and inclusion efforts.

  With the UK’s productivity performance under the spotlight, many employers know that a well-thought-out health and wellbeing strategy can help boost performance and make their company a better place to work.

  Adding greater flexibility to statutory sick pay so it supports mental as well as physical health makes sense and reflects the reality that 1 in 4 people will experience such an illness each year.

  Firms look forward to working with government to develop health and wellbeing approaches that work for business and for employees.


Prerana Issar, Chief People Officer, NHS England said:


  Helping people manage their health while at work through common sense measures like sickness absence management and occupational health services, is good for employees, better for employers and ultimately supports both the NHS and the economy.

  Today’s consultation is an important step in helping businesses to support their workers’ health and wellbeing, and while the NHS will continue to help people when they need it through our Long Term Plan, we will be able to do even more with strong backing from employers.


The consultation will also look at how to improve the capacity, value and quality of occupational health services and consider how to reduce the high costs, particularly for smaller employers.

The government wants to ensure all employers can access good advice and support so they understand and are able to act on their responsibilities to employees.
